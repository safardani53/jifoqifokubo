And he’s cool, he’s so kind," the mother of three told her co-stars.</p><p>"The chemistry is there. The connection is there," she continued to gush.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"He’s very career driven. He has his long term goals, his short terms goals. He’s very intelligent. Thoughtful. Compassionate."</p><p>At that point, Leah surprised her co-stars by admitting that she often feels as though she doesn’t "deserve" Jaylan’s affection.</p><p>"I don’t think that I don’t deserve it, but I also think I’m a little bit, ‘is this real?’" she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Maybe I have attracted someone that’s great, but at the same time I’m a little guarded, a little scared."</p><p>Jaylan made his Teen Mom debut during last week’s episode of Family Reunion, and the sparks seemed to fly between the two lovebirds.</p><p>But when he left to hit some golf balls with the other guys, Leah seemed to become despondent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Viewers were encouraged by the fact that Messer felt comfortable enough with Mobley to open up to him and share the things she had talked about with her trauma counselor.&nbsp;</p><p>But the fact remains that Messer seems to harbor some serious doubts about the future of this relationship.</p><p>And given the rocky nature of her romantic past, that’s not terribly surprising.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Leah has been divorced twice, and neither split was civil.</p><p>Since then, she’s been involved in multiple serious relationships, and at least one of them seemed to end badly.</p><p>So it makes sense that she would be feeling a little hesitant about letting her guard down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But fortunately, Leah seems to understand the importance of doing exactly that.</p><p>"I’m trying to accept your kindness. I need to let the walls come down and I’m scared to let the walls come down," she told Jaylan over the phone during a recent episode.</p><p>"I’m not planning to do this temporarily. I haven’t been in a relationship in a minute so I’m not just doing this s–t for fun," Mobley replied.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I plan on being here for a long time."</p><p>On tonight’s episode, the entire cast will sit down to reflect on their trip during a final dinner together.</p><p>Jaylan will likely be right be Leah’s side — and it sounds like he intends to maintain that position for many years to come.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WAcLjEmp9mpZWowKa%2BjJymp56VqMCmv4yfnJqqo2Kuo7vUrWSjmamhrq95zKiZpZ2pYrZusM6nq2asmJ67rHnHnqpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlie-chaplin-daughter-josephine-dead-escape-sun-bay.html><span>←</span><span>Charlie Chaplins daughter Josephine dead at 74 after star turns in Escape to the Sun and The Bay</span></a>
