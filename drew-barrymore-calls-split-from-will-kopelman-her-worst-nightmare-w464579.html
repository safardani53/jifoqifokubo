I so wanted to raise kids in this ultratraditional way and do everything so the polar opposite of my experience,” Barrymore — who called it quits with Kopelman last year after three years of marriage — told DeGeneres.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/will-kopelman-drew-barrymore-zoom-6849edc9-bd4e-4fda-8b5e-b8c103f73a02.jpg><p>However, the <i>Santa Clarita Diet</i> star said that she and and her former spouse have been able to work together to coparent their daughters in New York. “It really is about the tone you set, and you can talk until you’re blue in the face, but kids watch what you do every single day of your life, all day long, and that behavior and that example and that love and community and honesty is just, I think, what’s making everything feel safe for my kids,” she said. “And that’s really the intention I had as a parent — how do my kids have this incredible sense of, like, freedom inside their heart, because they know I’ve got them and their dad’s got them and the [rest of their family].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/drew-barrymore-ellen-degeneres-zoom-bedbdc62-73b3-4333-806a-2a9cb47308fc.jpg><p>She continued, “I got two families. I went from, like, zero to two and it’s a miracle and a blessing, and we do it in a way that I think a lot of other people are probably doing it too and sometimes, again, the road is different than what you tried to make it or what you expected and you just figure it out and figure it out with grace.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>During her chat with DeGeneres, Barrymore also recounted a recent — and quite emotional — trip to Disney World with her little girls. “We went to Disney World, which is such a dream come true for any family. You’re just seeing your kids’ joy, and I was just crying the whole time,” the proud mom of two said. “Cinderella thought I was nuts!”</p><p>Barrymore’s new series,&nbsp;<i>Santa Clarita Diet</i>, launches its 10-episode first season on Netflix Friday, February 3.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadqpWseqOt0auwpqeimnqkrculqmaroKG2tXnFq6amZaeeua15yqinnqSdlrtutMSrZLCnoqjBbrrIoJ%2BtpZGnsm7Dk29rbm9pZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dean-mcdermott-blindsided-tori-spelling-by-going-public-with-lily-calo.html><span>←</span><span>Dean BLINDSIDED Me by Going Public with Lily Calo</span></a>
