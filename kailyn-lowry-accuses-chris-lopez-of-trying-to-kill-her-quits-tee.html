We’ve been with you a long time. I am so sorry. I wish I’d known," Pinsky said before applauding Kail’s bravery in telling her tale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“No one would know this if you didn’t share it.

Whatever has been said about me from her can literally be said about them," Lopez argued in his own defense.</p><p>"There’s been abuse on both sides."</p><p>"Did you ever threaten her with violence or injure Kail?" Dr. Drew asked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Injure? No. She’s making it seem like I literally beat her… I never beat her," replied Chris.</p><p>However, Lopez did admit to threatening his ex and said that he wasn’t "innocent" in their relationship.</p><p>Kail concluded her segment by saying what might be her final goodbye to the show that made her famous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/kailyn-lowry-in-2022-1024x978.jpg><p>Rumors about <a href=#>Lowry quitting Teen Mom 2</a> have been circulating for months now, and last night, Kail seemed to confirm that she will not be returning for another season.</p><p>"I need to move on, I think I need to do my own thing," she said.</p><p>"I think this needs to be my farewell. I think I’m ready, I think that we should just part ways, I think this should just be the end."</p><p>Kail’s decision seemed final, but Dr. Drew left the door open for a possible return.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/kailyn-lowry-in-2022-1024x978.jpg><p>"I’m not gonna say goodbye to her today," he said.</p><p>Obviously, only time will tell, but it seems to us that Kail is well and truly done with the entire Teen Mom franchise.</p><p>And the flak she’s taken from the public and her costars over the past few years — all while attempting to heal from a profoundly traumatic incident — was likely a major factor in that decision.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WCcLfAoqOypl2hvLi%2B2GaYnJulqLK0ecKhqaKrXaG8sbHZZqafZaSnxqq6xmarqGWbnrmteceeqWappZ7BtHnTnpxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelor-in-paradises-kat-izzo-and-john-henry-break-up.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelor in Paradise's Kat Izzo and John Henry Break Up</span></a>
