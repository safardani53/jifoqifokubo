It happened so quickly, one moment he had been chewing this brochure, the next moment he couldn't open his mouth."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>Finlay was rushed to the practice with his mouth closed and four of his bottom teeth stuck together minutes after chewing the brochure on Wednesday&nbsp;morning.</p><p>He was anaesthetised before Scott and his colleagues spent 45 minutes using warm water, butter and dental equipment to remove the glue and prise his jaw open.</p><p>They managed to loosed the glue before using a dental scraper to lever it off and then discovered a piece of the brochure's paper the size of a 20p coin was still wrapped around one of Finlay's teeth.</p><p>The surgery now recommends owners whose pets are prone to stealing and chewing post to buy a letterbox cage as staff believe many pieces of common junk mail could pose the same danger.</p><p>Finlay's owner's have given permission for the veterinary surgery to share what happened to their pet as a warning to others.</p><p>Scott added: "We had to be very careful during the procedure because we didn't want to damage Finlay's gums, teeth or jaw.</p><p>"When we levered off the glue with a dental scraper&nbsp;there was a piece of paper the size of a 20 pence piece still wrapped round his teeth which was what had set hard.</p><p>"As soon as that came off, we brought him round and he was absolutely fine and is now completely recovered.</p><p>"But there were risks associated – any procedure where the animal is anesthetised has risks, and because of the nature of Finlay's jaw being stuck together it was more difficult to access his airways.</p><p>"We want people to be aware so this doesn't happen again, especially owners who know their dogs like to play with mail.</p><p>"This glue sets hard, so the sooner it can be dealt with the better. Finlay was pretty nonplussed but some dogs would get very distressed.</p><p>"The whole thing was definitely a very frightening experience for Finlay's owners."</p><b id=m_-3583138874361770550yiv4364993453yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1474621267627_46450>We pay for your stories!
