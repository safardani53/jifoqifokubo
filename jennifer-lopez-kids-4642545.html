Find out everything you need to know about the teenagers here.</p><h2><span><span><i>When were Max and Emme born?</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jennifer married Marc just months after her first split from <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ben Affleck</a></strong> in June 2004 (they divorced, however, in 2014). The two had been romantically linked in the past, and had previously collaborated on Spanish language duet “No Me Ames” on her 1999 debut album On The 6. Three years after the secretive wedding, the Maid In Manhattan star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced she was pregnant</a> on Nov. 8, 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Lopezs-Kids-Everything-To-Know-About-Her-Twins-Emme-Max-EMBED4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The then 38-year-old broke the news while she was on the joint El Cantante Tour with Marc in Miami after weeks of speculation.&nbsp;“Marc and I are expecting a baby!” she said as Marc cradled her bump. “We are happy…This is a special time in our lives. And we waited until the last show to tell you,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Just weeks before she gave birth, J.Lo’s dad <strong>David Lopez</strong> confirmed his middle daughter was expecting not one, but two babies. “Yes, twins…The thing is in my family, my sister also had twins, so it’s a hereditary thing,” he said on Spanish-language show Escéndalo TV. “I’m very proud. Jennifer has yearned to be a mother for many years.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The&nbsp;This Is Me…Then&nbsp;singer gave birth to Max and Emme on February 22, 2008 in Long Island, N.Y. The world waited just four short weeks for the first glimpse at the beautiful twins, who were featured on a March 2008 cover of&nbsp;PEOPLE&nbsp;magazine in a worldwide exclusive.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Years later, Jennifer reflected on finding out she has having twins in a YouTube video dubbed Twin Talk with a then 11-year-old Max and Emme.&nbsp;“When I realized I was pregnant, I was in Portugal. I was doing a big show and I had just went away for two days. When I sat there, I was in my hair and makeup trailer, and here’s what I felt,” she said to them. “In my belly, I felt a flutter. I felt like a little butterfly in stomach, and immediately I knew I had life inside of me. I knew it. It came right into my head.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Lopezs-Kids-Everything-To-Know-About-Her-Twins-Emme-Max-EMBED.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>It was at the doctor’s office she was told the news.&nbsp;“The doctor says, you see that right there, that little grain of rice? That’s the baby. You see this other little grain of rice over here? That’s the other baby,” she explained. “I was like ‘What.’ I started laughing hysterically. I just laughed out loud, I couldn’t believe it. And that’s how I found out I was having twins.”</p><h2><span><span><i>Max and Emme over the years</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>The “coconuts” (Jen’s nickname for them) have grown up in the spotlight, often being photographed with their superstar mom and her various romantic partners, including ex-boyfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Casper Smart</strong></a>, who she dated from 2011 to 2016, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ex-fiancé <strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a>, who she was with from 2017 – 2021, and rekindled beau <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ben Affleck</a></strong>, who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she reunited with in 2021</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Notably, Max and Emme were very close to Alex’s daughters <strong>Natasha</strong>, 16, and <strong>Ella</strong>, 13, who they were often pictured with in media and on their mom’s social media channels. In 2021, they’ve been spending a fair amount of time with Ben’s kids <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Violet</strong>, 16, <strong>Seraphina</strong>, 13, and <strong>Samuel</strong>, 9</a>, who he shares with ex-wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>, 49. And they are sure to spend even more time with Ben and his kids now that the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>superstar couple are married</a> and preparing for a huge celebration the weekend of August 19, 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>As a result of Bennifer’s rekindled romance, Max and Emme have been spending more time in Los Angeles <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>compared to Miami</a>, where their father Marc calls home, and Alex also maintained a residence (their mom also owns a $32 million Star Island home in the southern Florida city). Ahead of the 2021-2022 school year, J.Lo was also spotted checking out various exclusive <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>private schools around Los Angeles</a>, presumably to enroll the twins closer to her home in Bel-Air (and closer to Ben, who lives in Brentwood).</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Beyond being photographed extensively over the years by paparazzi, and being center stage on their mom’s Instagram, the two have also been on red carpets! The twins made their&nbsp;red carpet debut at just seven, attending the 2014 premiere of their mom’s animated flick Home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Lopezs-Kids-Everything-To-Know-About-Her-Twins-Emme-Max-EMBED2.jpg><h2><span><span><i>Emme stepping into the spotlight&nbsp;</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Jennifer recently revealed she refers to Emme using <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“they/them” pronouns</a>. Meanwhile, Emme stepped into the spotlight in a big way at the 2020 Super Bowl Halftime Show! The then 11-year-old impressively sang alongside Jennifer, who co-headlined the performance with <strong>Shakira</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Lopezs-Kids-Everything-To-Know-About-Her-Twins-Emme-Max-EMBED3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Emme popped out to sing a few lines of Bruce Springsteen’s “Born In The USA” — remixed with J.Lo’s Latina anthem “Lets Get Loud” — blowing the audience away! “If you wanna live your life/Live it all the way and don’t you waste it,” they sang while positioned in a cage, along with other children on stage. The moment was intentionally political, and a strong statement in response to former President Donald Trump’s immigration policy which separated families at the U.S./Mexico border.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>“All I want my girls, the little girls on stage with me and all over the world to know is how to use their voices and be proud of everything they are,” Jennifer said after the performance. “Other people can try to build walls, keep us out or put us in cages. We are proud to recognize that all of us together are what makes this beautiful country truly great.”</p><h2><span><span><i>Emme’s unique style&nbsp;</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>In 2021, Emme embraced a totally unique style of their own! The gorgeous teen decided to rock a funky, shorter due, and embrace their natural curls. Earlier in the spring, they also died their hair blue, which they debuted at a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nobu Malibu dinner</a> for aunt <strong>Lynda Lopez</strong>‘s birthday early on in Ben and Jennifer’s rekindled relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>The 14-year-old has also been channeling the ’90s in a series of retro inspired looks, including loose fitting jeans, vintage t-shirts and argyle sweaters, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vans sneakers</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>plenty of overalls</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Lopezs-Kids-Everything-To-Know-About-Her-Twins-Emme-Max-EMBED5-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-22>In advance of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>release of film&nbsp;Marry Me</a>, Jennifer talked about how Max and Emme are both finding their “own identities” with <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong>. “[They’re like] ‘It’s my life, I have my own identity, I am who I am, this is what I feel about the world, this is what I think.’…They need to distance themselves [from me],” she said, explaining that they are now “adult people in a little body.”</p><h2>Emme & Max At Bennifer 2.0’s Wedding</h2><p id=content-paragraph-23>Emme and Max almost<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> stole the spotlight</a> from their mom when she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married</a> <strong>Ben Affleck</strong> at his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>estate in Georgia</a> on August 20, 2022. Emme rocked a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>white blazer and pants </a>as they helped hold Jennifer’s dramatic veil attached to her Ralph Lauren gown. Max pulled up the rear in a hate and white suit as he was spotted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>holding hands</a> with Ben’s daughter <strong>Violet</strong> as they walked down the aisle together! It was truly a family affair!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mepaehlpq%2FbrjOqZyzZZuesbR5k29ra21kanw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-digitalnex-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is DigitalNex Dating Now</span></a>
