Alongside her incredible success as the cohost of <a href=#>Today</a>, the television journalist has also had her fair share of hardships throughout the years.</p><p>In 1988, when she was 16 years old, Guthrie’s dad died of a heart attack.</p><p>“Not far from mind or heart ever, ever: my dear daddy, Christmas baby like me,” the NBC personality <a href=#>reflected</a> while celebrating her 50th birthday in 2021. “He never turned 50 from 49. But tonight I have! So I treasure this gift of life and remember you always.”</p><p>Guthrie — who shares daughter Vale and son Charley, named after her father, with husband <a href=#><strong>Michael Feldman</strong></a> — has also been candid about the pregnancy loss she suffered after giving birth to Vale in 2014.</p><p>“I didn’t want to get my hopes up. I just tried to tell myself that it would be OK if it didn’t happen: Maybe it’s not meant for me, and that’s OK because I’ve already been blessed so much in my life. I’m not entitled to have a baby too,” the Australia native — Guthrie was born in Melbourne before being raised in Arizona — told <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a> in March 2022. “Looking back, that mindset was probably a self-defense mechanism.”</p><p>After deciding to undergo <a href=#>in-vitro fertilization treatments</a> (IVF) in order to have a second child, Guthrie realized just how much it takes to bring a child into this world.</p><p>“Going through what we did, it makes you realize that everything has to go just right to have a healthy baby. I really feel for so many women who are struggling and wishing and wondering, ‘When’s it gonna be my turn?’ I know. And I understand,” she told the magazine.</p><p>The attorney — before becoming a journalist, Guthrie graduated with her Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center in 2002 — has also dealt with <a href=#>numerous bouts of COVID-19</a> since she first tested positive for the coronavirus in January 2022. She was diagnosed with the virus again in May of that year and was <a href=#>forced to leave the Today show early</a> in February 2023 after testing positive mid-show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Savannah left early, she wasn’t feeling great, so she took a COVID test. It came back positive,” fellow anchor <strong>Sheinelle Jones</strong> told viewers at the time. “So of course as soon as we found out, she rushed home to rest up. So Savannah, we love you, wishing you a speedy recovery.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Guthrie’s ups and downs through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKLCwKelmqBdnMK1tNGinKxlpaXAbq3NnWSdp6ejwG671Z6pZqyYmnq6scCrqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./real-housewives-of-dubai-chanel-ayan-takes-people-backstage-reunion-glam.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Her Real Housewives of Dubai Reunion Glam</span></a>
