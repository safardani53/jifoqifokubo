The singer looked just as fabulous in the 2001 “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” music video as she did rocking Christmas pajamas last month! But JLo did point out that her abs have recently achieved a personal best, which she demonstrated by taking up the “10-Year Challenge” that has taken over Instagram. On Jan. 15, she shared before and after photos from 2009 and 2018 — the key difference? In 2009, JLo was rocking a big baby bump that held her now 10-year-old twins, <strong>Emme</strong> and <strong>Max</strong>.&nbsp;In 2018, she was shimmying in a teeny yellow bikini for her sexy music video with <strong>Bad Bunny</strong>,&nbsp;Te Guste. Both beautiful, and both different types of glows — see the transformation below!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Don’t think JLo has peaked, however. The Latin pop star revealed that even she has New Year’s resolutions for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her fitness plan</a>! “New year, new goals! 💪🏼you always ask me how to stay motivated and focused on my goals…new workout gear always works for me!😉😉,” JLo revealed in an Instagram post on Jan. 11, along with a photo showing off her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sculpted abdominals</a> once again.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Two days prior to the #fitspo picture, JLo was photographed in action at a gym in Santa Monica, Calif. with boyfriend <strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong>, 43! It helps that JLo has a fitness buddy to keep her motivated, as we learned both are “extremely fit people and very healthy people,” Alex Rodriguez Corporation Chief Operating Officer&nbsp;<strong>Jeff Lee&nbsp;</strong>told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>in an EXCLUSIVE&nbsp;interview. We also learned that Jennifer — who doesn’t drink, party or smoke — intimidates Alex’s CIO because she’s the “one person” the business man can’t keep up with! Now that’s girl power at it’s best.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Want to reminisce on even more throwback photos like the baby bump pictured here? Relive JLo’s beauty evolution in our gallery above to take a journey from 1996 (when JLo was just 26 years old) to today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH1ye5BuZqOdnqO2p7HRZqOoqJWvenJ8jLKcmqpdmLWiuMuepaCdXaW%2FprPNmqWtZZGXwG6uyKSgp6Fdnru0wMCgqZqlXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bakhar-nabieva.html><span>←</span><span>Bakhar Nabieva Biography</span></a>
