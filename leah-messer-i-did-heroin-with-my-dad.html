It was when you can’t find pain medication, there was the heroin. [It’s] cheaper, and an easier form," Leah added.</p><p>"I was actually with my dad when I had done it," Messer said, adding that she made an error in judgement common to first-time drug users:</p><p>“I thought I could avoid [becoming addicted],” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I didn’t feel dependent on the medication I was taking at the time, until it was too late and I became suicidal.”&nbsp;</p><p>Leah’s addiction was the result of her painful and traumatic delivery of her youngest daughter.</p><p>“I remember it leading into smoking the pills, it led me to try heroin," she told the podcast hosts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I was in the public eye and I had to keep up with this persona, or this image and [in treatment] I had to let all of that go,” she said.</p><p>Leah says she felt the need to lie about her addiction due to a bitter custody battle with ex-husband Corey Simms.</p><p>She credits the producers of TM2 for helping her quietly enter a rehab facility and get clean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>[‘Teen Mom’ producer] Larry [Musnik] specifically was the biggest support system I had,” she said.</p><p>“I was in a really, really tough custody battle [with Corey Simms] and being able to own that I was struggling with addiction was impossible. I was being hair follicle drug-tested. I was going to lose custody of my children," Leah continued.</p><p>"That was even more shameful for me. That’s my entire world. If I lose them, I felt like I didn’t have anything to live for," she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“And the Executive Producer was like, ‘Leah. The best thing for them is for you to go to the treatment facility and get the help that you need and deserve. That was the support system I had.”</p><p>Obviously, Teen Mom stardom has not had a positive effect on the life of every cast member, but it sounds like the show may have literally saved Leah’s life.</p><p>We applaud her for being so candid about her experiences.</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Leah Messer Admits to Heroin Use in Shocking New Interview</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2Z9cLjEmp9mpZWowKa%2BjKJknaGUYrWmvs6ipWavmam1brnYZpuanF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./his-dark-materials-season-3-is-set-to-be-released-on-hbo.html><span>←</span><span>His Dark Materials Season 3 Is Set To Be Released On HBO</span></a>
