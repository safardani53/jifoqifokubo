Her name is Janet, and he did discuss having a crush on her in his past videos.&nbsp;</p><p>"The girl that was in my videos before, called my crush, aka Ms. Janet. I can say that, as a man, it was more than that. Definitely. It was more of just a thing I did for the first time," the 25-year-old explained about embarking on their romance behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>While he said that the two had never made their romance official, it's clear that they are serious. &nbsp;</p><p>"She can't leave me alone. I can't leave her alone," he continued with a smirk.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He said that he simply made a choice to keep his private life off camera, but that he was forging a relationship with Janet since 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're expecting. We don't know the gender yet," he said in the video, before adding that Janet was three months pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p>He also noted that he had completed a paternity test for "peace of mind."&nbsp;</p><p>After the paternity test confirmed that he was the father with 99.9 percent certainty, FlightReacts fully embraced this next chapter.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It's no longer just about me. It's no longer just about her," he said. "It's about a whole 'nother life."</p><p>Not much else is known about Janet publicly, including her last name. People online have speculated that Janet used to have an active OnlyFans account based on the placement of her tattoos, but this cannot be confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>FlightReacts does not follow anyone named Janet on Instagram. The account that appears to have been linked to Janet in the past is no longer active. The TikTok account associated with her Instagram handle is also set to private.&nbsp;</p><p>Later on in the announcement video, Janet introduced herself. She discussed her thoughts on becoming a mom.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I'm excited but kind of scared at the same time," Janet said. "I just want my kid to be healthy and live a good life, which I don't doubt. At the same time, I could have waited another year. But I don't regret anything. I am happy, but I'm just scared for my kid because there's a lot going on in this world."&nbsp;</p><p>Janet went on to say that she's especially excited to learn the sex of the baby. FlightReacts said that if it's a boy, he will definitely be in the NBA one day.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are FlightReacts' exes?</h2><p>Before he began seeing Janet, FlightReacts had a joint YouTube channel with fellow content creator Ariel Diaz.
