That was a week full of playing cards, cornhole, drinking, eating. It was like such wholesome just being together [time].”</p><p class=p1>Haines has been a permanent fixture on&nbsp;<i>The View&nbsp;</i>since 2020’s season 24 after previously serving as a guest at the table.</p><p class=p1>“When I joined, there was this chill camaraderie — definitely disagreements but then it was done — and then there was a time that was more fiery and this last season has felt back to normal,” the&nbsp;<i>Chase&nbsp;</i>host told the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Des Moines Register</a>&nbsp;</i>last month. “We can disagree and none of us take it personally. Conversation has gotten back to ideas, which is what it&nbsp;should be. You walk away [every day] and leave it behind and come back — it feels good again.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “<i>The View</i>&nbsp;is about tuning in. It’s an honor to sit at that table but you have to know&nbsp;where you stand and read into a lot.”</p><p class=p1>While Haines — who previously appeared on the&nbsp;<i>Today&nbsp;</i>show and ABC’s&nbsp;<i>Strahan and Sara&nbsp;</i>— is no stranger to live TV and <a href=#>dealing with unexpected events</a> including wardrobe challenges, she is also focused on raising her three little ones.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I think [going from two] to three, I haven’t really completely noticed because you already know that you just are going to have to divide and conquer,” Haines <a href=#>previously told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in September 2019</a><i>.</i>&nbsp;“So I don’t think I’ve felt the jump as supremely. It’s just keeping those toddlers, who are, like, climbing the walls, alive.”</p><p class=p1>During Tuesday’s season 26 premiere, Haines even noted that she enjoyed being with the kids and<a href=#> handling school drop-off</a> during the&nbsp;<i>View&nbsp;</i>hiatus. “I felt like such a mom [when I pulled up],” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJViw6qx1qxkrJmilnqprcinnKxlnJbCqLTSZqafnl2srrOw0aiZnmWdlrmnwc2cq6KnnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosario-dawson-husband-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Know If Rosario Dawson Has A Husband Or Dating A Boyfriend</span></a>
