I found raccoons. I found everything," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And it looked like she would remain in urban life after she rose to fame at 15 with a costarring role in her first film, Thirteen, and went on to act in dozens of major movies, including the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>mega-hit Twilight series</a>. But after marrying Vampire Diaries star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ian Somerhalder</a> in 2015 and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>giving birth to their daughter Bodhi</a> in July 2017, they decided it was time to escape to nature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For more on Reed and the benefits of getting out in nature, pick up this week's issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was a turning point for me," she says. "I made a conscious choice to give my child the most normal life possible."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That meant moving to a farm "very far outside the city" where they raise goats, cows, dogs and horses, and grow lavender and rosemary alongside cucumbers and peppers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It felt like a relief, moving out of the city," Reed says. "I promise that if anybody wants a feeling of ease, of peace, of calm, the answer is nature."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At their farm, the now-4-year-old Bodhi is "learning to grow things, getting your hands dirty in the soil," Reed says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My greatest joy is watching my daughter run through the dirt with her shoes off," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And it makes a huge impact on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Reed's mental health</a>, who now spends her days cuddling her cows, riding horses and growing tomatoes in the yard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Nature is the best form of therapy," she says. "And it's instant — you don't have to spend six months in nature before you feel it. Go on a hike and release endorphins. Look at a tree instead of the blue light on your phone. All of our souls need a dose of that kind of medicine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now busy with life on the farm, Reed has taken a step back from her acting career, but has started a nature-inspired jewelry company, BaYou with Love, and is designing a line of shoes for vegan sneaker company Løci.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was a very scary pivot for me to leave the only career I had ever known, that I had worked in since I was 13, to try something new," she says. "But I learned a lot about what's important to me. A lot of things that came with a Hollywood lifestyle, there isn't synergy with the priorities I now have in my life and with the people I want to surround myself with."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Nikki Reed on Beauty's Best Friends</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reed's priorities lie in caring for her family, their animals and reaping the all benefits of nature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Peace, calm, plants, animals — this is what keeps us healthy," she says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2iuobFdo7ast8hmqZ6dlGK5prLTZp%2BopJyuxLC7w2adqKpdm66zuYyloJ%2BdXaOutcHRnmSiq12ptaZ5wZ6qrWWWpL%2Buec6fZK2glaeuscWO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-cameron-my-relationship-with-hannah-brown-is-complicated-o.html><span>←</span><span>My Relationship with Hannah Brown is Complicated, Okay?!?</span></a>
