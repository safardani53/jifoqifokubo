It’s an advanced season.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This season will also see Dubrow handle a “very emotional” case while Nassif tackles the biggest challenge of his career.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I have the biggest case I've ever done in my career for the show. It involves a tumor taking over someone's face,” Nassif shares, noting that it’s the “most shocking” case he’s seen, among many other difficult procedures this season. “I also have more complications and more surgeries that I've had to revise than I’ve ever had on any season. It's just a hard season.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>'s free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dubrow and Nassif also talked about how Hollywood trends have impacted their clientele — both on and off the show.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One trend they've noticed is the desire for people to reverse their cosmetic procedures, copying celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Blac Chyna</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kylie Jenner</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>McKenzie Westmore</a> and more. However, the doctors stress that unlike some Hollywood trends they try to steer patients away from —&nbsp;like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>buccal fat removal</a> — they’re actually fans of the latest fad.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Celebrities move the needle,” Dubrow explains. “So if celebrities are doing things that are actually helpful, like reversing procedures that are maybe a little too much — they're having <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>too much fillers so they're dissolving it</a>, they're<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> taking their implants out</a> because they realized that they probably had it too young — I think that's an important message that maybe a lot of the procedures that are done should be done later in life.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If someone looks unnatural, different, just not themselves, that's not where you want to go,” Nassif adds. “So we love the idea of trying to reverse that and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>become more natural if possible</a>.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Casey Durkin/E! Entertainment</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Less is more in plastic surgery, Dubrow says, which is why a lot more clients are hoping to achieve a subtle look with their cosmetic procedures. Because Hollywood trends come and go, both doctors have always emphasized the need to be careful in making the decision to undergo any kind of procedure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Our goal is to actually educate and say, ‘Listen, you don't wanna do this.’ In the last nine months, I probably have turned down 25 patients, all young, all unnecessary surgery, not needing it,” Nassif tells PEOPLE.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think it's important that the doctor asks the patient and the patient asks themselves why and what,” Dubrow says. “Why do you want this done? Are you doing it for the right reasons and what consequences may you have in the future if you have this done at this stage? And if you have a really honest, open discussion about that, it may be able to inform and influence making a good <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>decision that you won't regret later</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Season 8 of Botched premieres August 3 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on E!<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5KkwaS0xJ1krJ2RqLyveZdmq56qoq56pcHBq6awZaCWwq15zZqqrKGWYrK5r8uuqqKulWKEdoKYam9u</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-owen-joyner-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Owen Joyner Dating Now</span></a>
