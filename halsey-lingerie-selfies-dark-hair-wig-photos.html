Halsey’s “Serendipity” ink, which sits right below her left breast, was exposed, as well as her left and right wrists tattoo. She accessorized with a chunky gold locket necklace and sported orange bronzy eyes with an orange-nude lip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The edgy photos certainly caught the attention of fans, who showered the singer with praise in the comments. “Let them know baby,” one hype fan wrote. Another added, “God damn perfection, you’re so gorgeous!”&nbsp;Other loyal fans made sure to remind Halsey that they could “never forget” her long locks while she’s enjoying being bald. “Honey you don’t need to remind us, WE BEEN KNEW!,” one fan spoke on behalf of her beloved followers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>It’s no secret that Halsey fearlessly enjoys switching up her look. The “You Should Be Sad” singer first debuted her bald do’ in a&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok video</a> on October 19. She took part in the viral&nbsp;“Girl Don’t Do It It’s Not Worth It” challenge, which shows TikTok users narrating a moment in which they’re tempted to do something risky — then, when they claim they “won’t do it,” they indeed do it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Halsey’s TikTok video showed the singer sporting long, dark locks before she debuted a completely shaved head — arguably her most radical hair transformation to date. But, she wasn’t done there. On November 11, Halsey showed off another new hair makeover. This time, the New York Times best-selling author debuted a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>new (tie) dye job</a>, in which her buzzcut was covered in blue and green designs. We love how bold Halsey is when it comes to transforming her look!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ye5FsZqGZnKiyunnLoqWgnaKesm6%2FxKWdop2jYrGivspmn5qhomLEqrOMqZ%2BorJ%2BofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-la-land-choreographer-on-making-emma-stone-ryan-gosling-dance.html><span>←</span><span>La La Land's Choreographer on Making Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling Dance</span></a>
