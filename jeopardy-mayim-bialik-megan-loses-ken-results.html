He’s going straight to the bottom of the board. Love that for him," one tweeted on the new player's performance.</p><p>By Final Jeopardy, Megan was in last place with $5,600 to middle podium Sarah’s $7000 and Jeff’s $7000.</p><p>She then tried her proven strategic betting pattern, wagering $1,401 - which would have made her a $1 winner.</p><p>But while she got FJ correct, with $7001 to Jeff's $7000, he hadn't yet revealed his response or wager.</p><p>Jeff also got the clue correct and laid down the law with a big bet and $11.2K total.</p><p>"I've never been so happy to see someone I like lose at jeopardy," ripped one viewer.</p><p>"I'm going to lose my mind if the current Jeopardy champ wins another game by $2" wrote another.</p><p>A third Twitter user accused on her streak, "the judges keep assisting her."</p><p>And on YouTube, one viewer wrote: "How many times is she going to win by two dollars? The fix is so obvious."</p><p>One of Megan's three $2 victories was her first, when she defeated&nbsp;<a href=#>then-champ Eric Ahasic.</a></p><p>Since then, she was clearly trivia-savvy but also "lucky" as many have posted - frequently also winning by strange defaults like players over-wagering in the final moments.</p><p>Canadian tattoo-toting tutor&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>beloved rideshare driver Ryan Long</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>, Matt Amodio, Eric, and now Megan - all from this streak-heavy season - will compete in the Tournament of Champions in November.</p><h2>MAYIM MAYHEM</h2><p>Mayim has faced a scoreboard of backlash as host.</p><p>Ken and Mayim began filling in for&nbsp;the legendary&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>&nbsp;after his&nbsp;<a href=#>tragic 2020 passing</a>&nbsp;and a fleet of Season 37 celebrity guest hosts, including now-disgraced&nbsp;<a href=#>Mike Richards</a>.</p><p>The fact that the hosting slot is still undecided has earned quite the debate, as the&nbsp;late Alex&nbsp;had hosted since 1984.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>show's ratings nearly doubled</a>&nbsp;to 9.7M viewers when&nbsp;Ken made his first appearance.</p><p>When&nbsp;Mayim took over her hosting duties the headcount dropped to 5.9 million viewers during a college championship and&nbsp;indeed,&nbsp;<a href=#>she hasn't bested Ken's ratings since during Season 38.</a></p><p>Mayim was a front-seat passenger for Ryan's 16-game streak - as many players said he was their "favorite contestant ever,"&nbsp;<a href=#>it was an empathetically good look for the actress too.</a></p><p>Many fans have found Mayim to be a perfectly palatable presence, but hundreds have tweeted about her off-putting poise during the typically enjoyable Q&A segments.</p><p>Mayim, who studied neuroscience,&nbsp;<a href=#>replied to one contestant's earnest autism testing Q&A with a joke:</a>&nbsp;"Glad to hear spitting in a tube went better than taking blood."</p><p><a href=#>Mayim had another joke that flatlined</a>&nbsp;with fans - she told a doctor he was "just an anesthesiologist, not a surgeon."</p><p>She also recently made an&nbsp;<a href=#>off-color joke about marijuana</a>&nbsp;and seemed to misunderstand the&nbsp;<a href=#>legacy of the band Queen.</a></p><p>Fans have also found Mayim to be&nbsp;<a href=#>slow with simply ruling responses correct or not in general.</a></p><p>One Twitter user wrote on Mayim's hosting hesitancy, "She's laggy, I think often it's because she's waiting for cues from the producers, but someone said it might be due to her being edited a lot.</p><p>"The thing about Ken ... he actually knows the answers...because he's that guy."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>Amy and&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea</a>&nbsp;- whose run ended the day before Ken shared his podium pause - stated&nbsp;<a href=#>afterward they wanted the 'Greatest of All Time' winner to take over</a>.</p><p>Jeff will go for win number two tomorrow night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-7.28.13-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-7.28.31-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000742197038.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htZmd9dIOQaKGep6CWv6XFjKaYsqGdYq%2BqrcuiomallZyur3nLqKqeq12gsq950Z6qrqSkqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kelly-willis-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kelly Willis Dating Now</span></a>
