The shot was brilliantly finger-tipped behind by keeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell at full stretch.</p><p>Daniel Johnson then warmed Peacock-Farrell’s palms with a fierce low drive from the edge of the box before the hosts got a foothold on the game.</p><p>Leeds squandered a glorious chance to go in front on 13 minutes when midfielder Jack Harrison, on loan from Manchester City, released Mateusz Klich with a defence-splitting through-ball.</p><p>Klich, with only keeper Declan Rudd to beat, looked a certain scorer — but the Polish international hitman disappointingly dragged his low effort wide.</p><p>The home side did have the ball in the net on the half-hour through Ezgjan Alioski’s effort, though it was rightly ruled out for offside by ref Geoff Eltringham.</p><p>North End were being pressed into desperate defensive duty as Leeds piled on the pressure but their brave resistance came to an end before the break.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Watch all the Premier League action from Saturday, Sunday and Monday in our Weekend Roundup</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004350517771-e1537301186583.jpg><p>Barry Douglas, the set-play maestro mysteriously discarded by top-flight Wolves in the summer, picked out Liam Cooper with a precision corner.</p><p>Centre-back Cooper did not make the best of contacts with a diving header but it was good enough to deceive Rudd. He could only push the ball on to his right-hand post before it nestled in the net.</p><p>United should have doubled their advantage three minutes later.</p><p>Klich, however, chalked up his second bad miss of the night by blazing over the bar from 12-yards.</p><p>Dead-eyed Douglas was again the provider — this time from a free-kick — for Pontus Jansson to have a diving header turned away for a corner by centre-back Ben Davies.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in football</h2></p><p>The hard-working Robinson had the ball in the net for the Lilywhites on 57 minutes but, once again, the officials were right to rule out the effort for offside.</p><p>If anyone deserved a goal for his efforts it was Robinson and he came close again with a wicked angled effort which flew inches over the bar.</p><p>Harrison then fired against the post before Roberts conjured up his first goals for the club since arriving from West Brom in January.</p><p>The Welshman notched after 74 minutes with a lob and sealed it eight minutes later with by heading home a Klich cross.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2x%2Fen2Qb2topJWasbR51KegrZ2UYr2zsdKtpqdlnqS%2FtbSMnqWdZZOdrq68yKilrKCZpXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lara-sebastian-19890415-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lara Sebastian (Vine Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
