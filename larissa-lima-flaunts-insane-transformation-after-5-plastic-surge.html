Season 5.</p><p>Then, in August, Larissa received liposuction, a tummy tuck, and a fat transfer — losing just a few pounds from her midsection during an abdominoplasty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>One pound of fat each went into her butt cheeks, but the transfer was not all that happened with ehr booty.</p><p>Dr. Lane Smith also included fillers and Sculptra in her butt.</p><p>Larissa is opening up about the procedures, her decision to undergo them, and of course her brand new OnlyFans account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Speaking to <a href=#>Life & Style</a>, Larissa explains the extra ingredients that went into her butt.</p><p>“It’s kind of like fat transfer but it’s a different product they inject in the butt," she shares.</p><p>Larissa clarifies: "It’s very safe, it’s not illegal, it’s hydrochloric acid."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The reason that Larissa chose do undergo these surgeries only six months apart was so that she could get them out of the way and continue her work as an influencer.</p><p>“It was a little bit, ‘Right now, let’s do it right now, but I need to hurry because my job [is] on social media,’” Larissa explains.</p><p>“But now," she declares, "I’m almost [fully] recovered.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Larissa is also wearing Bellami hair extensions.</p><p>“Now I have long luscious hair I can’t live without,” Larissa raves.</p><p>She is also reassuring fans who were worried after they saw her struggle to wake up after her February surgery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“The thing that you watched is a little tricky because [when you] wake up from anesthesia, [you] wake up like, ‘Uhhhh, where I am? What am I doing here?’" Larissa explains.</p><p>She adds: "They put a thing inside your mouth so they ask you, ‘breathe, breathe.’"</p><p>“So the show has some kind of drama, you know," Larissa notes. 90 Day Fiance does love to make things look worse than they are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“My bra size was 34A and now it’s 34 double or triple D," Larissa announces.</p><p>Though she acknowledges that she had a hard time recovering from that operation, she adds: "I am very happy with the results."</p><p>”When I went to Victoria’s Secret I could fit into double D or triple D but the one I chose was triple D," she shares.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In a similar yet opposite vein, Larissa enjoys that she has now gone down two pant sizes after her abdominoplasty.</p><p>As for why she went under the knife, Larissa shares: “The reason that I did it because as you know, I have a family in Brazil."</p><p>"I have a boyfriend who is 28 years old and I am exposed daily on social media,” she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“People have haters but the lovers, they ask you what procedures you use, what clothes that [you have] on," Larissa notes.</p><p>"So, she reasons, "I want to look good for myself and to make money to send to Brazil and to make a living here.”</p><p>Additionally, having given birth to son Arry and daughter Luana, her abdominal muscles had separated and no amount of exercise could fix them — but surgery could, and now it has.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“We use filters and Photoshop all of the time," Larissa says.</p><p>She shares: "I was using filters to make my waist look skinnier, so this surgery brings me freedom."</p><p>All told, she reportedly spent over $70,000 on surgery … but Larissa is on track to recoup those expenses, and then some.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>$30,000 of that came in the form of a loan from Eric, as we all saw, because Larissa was not yet allowed to legally work in the US.</p><p>That changed when she got her work authorization and could then be paid — in particular, paid for doing Cameos.</p><p>Larissa reveals that she has raked in $50,000 in Cameo money to date, and saying of Eric: "I paid [him] back for everything."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Now, Larissa has added another revenue stream — just this week, she created her OnlyFans account.</p><p>“It’s going to be in addition to Cameo,” Larissa confirms.</p><p>“I don’t have time to always film for all the requests I have," she shares, "so I want to be more like take a photo and post it, very quick and I’m done. I don’t need to interact, it’s very quick."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"OnlyFans is a platform that people make a living, buying houses, buying cars," Larissa observes.</p><p>She predicts: "I believe I’m going to be okay with OnlyFans.”</p><p>As for what inspired her to join a number of 90 Day Fiance castmates, including her boyfriend Eric, on OnlyFans, it dates back to her divorce party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In early 2019, Larissa was thrown a divorce party at Crazy Horse III, a Vegas gentleman’s club, where she felt inspired by the sex workers who were working there as strippers.</p><p>“I started to realize, I understand their job as a sex worker, but I can do something softer and still make money,” Larissa recalls.</p><p>“Some of the girls have houses of one million dollars," she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Larissa continues: "So I say, ‘Wait, I don’t need to do [anything] pornographic, but I have [followers] on my Instagram [who are] kids, teenagers, grandmothers.’"</p><p>"’Sometimes I want to take sexy photos, show myself feeling good," she notes. “The OnlyFans can give me the money and the exposure too."</p><p>Larissa once again emphasizes that she won’t be doing anything explicit, saying: “I want to be sexy but more high-end, like Maxim, everything is tasteful and I’m embracing my new look.”</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>90 Day Fiance: Is Andrei Castravet Gonna Beat Up Charlie Potthast in Moldova??</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WGcLjAq6Csq5Fiuaq5wGadpZmlo8G0ecinqpqmlWLBs63NrJ2oqp2Wwaq7zWaYn6yVp3p2ec%2BlmKysmZh6tMHRoJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danny-kaye.html><span>←</span><span>Danny Kaye</span></a>
