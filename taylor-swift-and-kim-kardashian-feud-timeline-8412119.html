The Internet immediately seemed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>side with the reality star,</a> and #KimExposedTaylorParty started trending.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following year, Swift responded to the drama with her sixth studio album Reputation, which was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dominated by snake imagery</a> as she reclaimed the snake emoji posted in her Instagram comments section at the time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Swift prepares to release the re-recorded version of Reputation, the “Bad Blood” singer recently reflected on the feud with TIME as she was named the publication’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2023 Person of the Year</a>, noting that the public’s reaction felt like “a career death” and “took [her] down psychologically to a place [she’d] never been before.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, take a look back at Swift and Kardashian’s relationship through the years, including what they’ve said about the drama.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2009-kim-kardashian-says-she-loves-taylor-swift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2009: Kim Kardashian says she "loves" Taylor Swift&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2009, Kardashian spoke with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Entertainment Tonight</a> on the red carpet, where they asked her what the No. 1 song her iPod was.

After giving a speech about West on stage, she was seen with her arms wrapped around Kardashian as they smiled at West on stage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the friendship was short-lived as the following February, West released his song “Famous” featuring a dig at Swift, saying he "made that bitch famous." Swift publicly reacted to the lyric during her Grammys acceptance speech for album of the year.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame," she said on stage.

"Taylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West," the statement about Kardashian started off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"However, that does not change the fact that much of what Kim is saying is incorrect. Kanye West and Taylor only spoke once on the phone while she was on vacation with her family in January of 2016 and they have never spoken since," the statement continued. "Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-july-17-2016-kim-kardashian-explains-why-she-defended-kanye-west-against-taylor-swift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>July 17, 2016: Kim Kardashian explains why she defended Kanye West against Taylor Swift</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a July 2016 episode</a> of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the family discussed the longstanding feud between West and Swift in great detail, as well as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>West's controversial rant</a> during his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was recorded backstage calling Swift fake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She explained that when she did her GQ interview, she felt the need to speak out. "I never talk s--- about anyone publicly, especially in interviews. But I was just like, I had so had it," she said "I wanted to defend him in it.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of the episode, Kardashian sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the controversial interview. Jenner tried to play peacemaker, asking, "What would happen if you just called Taylor up and say 'What happened? How did this go so south?' I guess I don't understand the motivation to flip … maybe she took it the wrong way. My advice would be to give Taylor Swift a call."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Thank you for your lovely advice," Kardashian told her mother, "but I'm not going to take it."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-july-17-2016-kim-kardashian-releases-video-footage-of-kanye-wests-phone-call-with-taylor-swift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>July 17, 2016: Kim Kardashian releases video footage of Kanye West's phone call with Taylor Swift</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Immediately following that episode of KUWTK, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kardashian took to Snapchat</a> to share a series of truncated videos of the phone call between her then-husband West and Swift, discussing the "Famous" lyrics – as well as their history.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's like a compliment," Swift is heard saying in the video after West reads the lyrics to her (which include, "For all my Southside n----- that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex").</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What I give a f--- is you as a person, and as a friend, I want things that make you feel good," West said, and thanked Swift "for being like, so cool about it" after she told him she appreciates the "heads up" on the lyrics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I never would've expected you to like tell me about a line in your song," Swift said. "I mean, I don't think anybody would listen to that and be like, 'Oh, that's a real diss.' You gotta tell the story that way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to add, "If people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like, 'He called me and told me before it came out … Joke's on you, guys. We're fine.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after, Swift's rep told PEOPLE, "Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyrics, 'I made that bitch famous.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Internet immediately seemed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>side with the reality star</a>, and #KimExposedTaylorParty started trending.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-july-17-2016-taylor-swift-defends-herself-after-kim-kardashian-releases-kanye-west-phone-call-footage></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>July 17, 2016: Taylor Swift defends herself after Kim Kardashian releases Kanye West phone call footage</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Swift quickly defended herself</a> online, noting how the phone call never showed West telling Swift he was going to call her “that bitch.” "It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world," she wrote in a note.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009," Swift continued. She captioned the post, "That moment when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kanye West</a> secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-august-27-2017-taylor-swift-references-kanye-west-and-kim-kardashian-drama-in-look-what-you-made-me-do-music-video></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>August 27, 2017: Taylor Swift references Kanye West and Kim Kardashian drama in “Look What You Made Me Do” music video&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Almost a year after Kardashian shared the secretly recorded phone call on her Snapchat between her then-husband West and Swift, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Swift announced the release of her sixth studio album, Reputation</a>. Swift teased the news with a series of mysterious Instagram videos depicting a serpent. This appeared to be her way of reclaiming the snake emoji posted in her Instagram comments section (implying that she was a liar).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the music video for the song’s lead single “Look What You Made Me Do,” Swift referenced the drama with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>various Easter eggs throughout the video</a>. In addition to having various snake imagery throughout, she also had the quote “Et tu, Brute” from William Shakespeare’s play Julius Caesar written on her chair as a reference to West stabbing her in the back.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of the video, she further referenced the drama as several different “versions of herself” lined up in a row, including one that kept taking videos on her phone, saying, “I’m going to edit this later.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-january-14-2019-kim-kardashian-claims-theres-no-more-bad-blood-with-taylor-swift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>January 14, 2019: Kim Kardashian claims there’s no more “Bad Blood” with Taylor Swift</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2019, Kardashian <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cleared the air</a> during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Andy Cohen</a>, during the show's "Squash That Beef!" segment. When asked about if her feud with Swift over the leaked phone calls was still ongoing, she said she was "over it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel like we'd all moved on," Kardashian added of the tension between them.

"In my experience, I've come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can't tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans," she wrote.

I wanted you to put the song out," he tells the Grammy winner on the phone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After telling Swift he included a "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>very controversial line</a>" about her in the song, the pop star appeared to be nervous as she asks West what the lyrics are. A seemingly wary Swift asks if it's "gonna be mean," and West acknowledges even then-wife Kardashian initially felt it was "too crazy" but had come around. "It's like my wife's favorite f---ing line," he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So it says, 'To all my Southside n----- that know me best/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex," continues West with a chuckle. Responds Swift with a laugh: "That's not mean."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Further discussing his proposal to have her release the song, Swift — who expresses relief that the lyrics aren't about her being "that stupid dumb bitch" — tells West she needs to "think about it because it is absolutely crazy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm going to send you the song and send you the exact wording and everything about it, right? And then we could sit and talk through it," West tells Swift, who has long contended she never heard the song before its release, at the end of the call.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Days later, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kardashian liked a tweet</a> referencing the leak, stating, "The video showed nothing new. We all knew that. I'm so confused right now," reads the tweet.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-march-23-2020-taylor-swift-responds-to-the-leak-of-her-full-phone-call-with-kanye-west></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>March 23, 2020: Taylor Swift responds to the leak of her full phone call with Kanye West</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-114 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Instead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family and fans through hell for 4 years)…SWIPE UP to see what really matters," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote Swift on Instagram Stories</a> on March 23, referencing the leaked call.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-116 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The World Health Organization and Feeding America are some of the organizations I've been donating to.
