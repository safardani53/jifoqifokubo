The vagina is a delicate balance of flora, and two conditions commonly strike when things go off-course.
Thrush affects three quarters of females in the UK at least once in lifetime.
And bacterial vaginosis (BV) affects one-third.
This makes the two conditions extremely common, yet not something to be brushed off.
Both need treatment, but thankfully over-the-counter medication is available."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
