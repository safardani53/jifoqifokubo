I love color in general.”</p><p>Taste wise, the model says she wanted to include raspberry because of its “very appealing and beautiful color,” and added a garnish of candied ginger to cut the sweetness of the drink while simultaneously “brightening it up a bit.”</p><p>Since the drink is so vibrant, the Rhode Island native even plans to use it as a way to spice up her table settings when hosting holiday parties. “My event décor is usually inspired by what I’m serving, and my signature cocktail is the centerpiece,” she tells Us. “I love the look of a bright cocktail set against a chic, sophisticated backdrop such as a sleek tray or modern marble accents. A touch of greenery or beautiful florals complement the pop of color in the cocktail nicely.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/The-Red-Carpet-Cosmo-by-Olivia-Culpo.jpg><p>Overall, Culpo just hopes her cocktail will bring people together during this festive season, explaining, “I hope that people will be able to take this recipe and bring it home for the holidays.”</p><p>Take a look at the recipe below!</p><p><strong>Olivia Culpo’s Cointreau Red Carpet Cosmo</strong></p><p>Makes 1 serving</p><p>INGREDIENTS:</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>• 3/4 oz Cointreau<br>• 2 oz vodka<br>• 3/4 oz fresh lime juice<br>• Bar spoon of raspberry jam<br>• Candied ginger, for garnish</p><p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p><li>Combine all ingredients in a shaker.
