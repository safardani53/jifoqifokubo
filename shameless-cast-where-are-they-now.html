The long-running dramedy Shameless <a href=#>wrapped up its 10-year run in April 2021</a>, but the Gallagher family’s antics will always live on in viewers’ hearts.</p><p>Based on a British TV show of the same name, Shameless premiered on Showtime in January 2011. <a href=#><strong>William H. Macy</strong></a> anchored the cast as Frank Gallagher, the family patriarch. As Frank struggled with alcohol and drug addictions, he relied on his six children to financially support him and their siblings.</p><p>“The Gallaghers live right on the edge of the law, and they have to skirt the law a lot to make it,” the Emmy winner told Vanity Fair in August 2018. “They’re one paycheck away from homelessness. And it’s a really interesting family to follow, to see what that’s really like. And we make light of it, and it’s sanitized a little bit, but the writers have been really good at, every once in a while, reminding you — this is serious s—t.”</p><p>The series, set in Chicago, racked up 15 Emmy nominations during its 11 seasons, winning four. Macy never won any of his six nods for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, but he did take home three Screen Actors Guild Awards for his performance, winning in 2015, 2017 and 2018.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Emmy Rossum</strong></a>, arguably the show’s other biggest star, made headlines in August 2018 when <a href=#>she announced that she was leaving the series</a> after season 9. “I know you will continue on without me, for now,” she wrote in a Facebook statement at the time. “There is much more Gallagher story to be told. I will always be rooting for my family. Try not to think of me as gone, just think of me as moving down the block.”</p><p>After the series finale aired in April 2021, however, her former costar <a href=#><strong>Emma Kenney</strong></a> said “the set became more of a positive place” following Rossum’s departure.</p><p>“I remember pre her leaving, I’d go to set some days and I’d be very anxious having a scene with her because if she had a bad day, she made it a bad day for everybody,” <a href=#>the Conners alum said during an October 2021 episode</a> of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite any past tension, <a href=#>Kenney added that she still has “a lot of love”</a> for the Phantom of the Opera star. “I hope she finds her happiness,” she added.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see what the Shameless cast is doing now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BotaK5xKWcrKtdmK60wIywn56qlWKus7GMrZ%2BesV2jvLh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melissas-friend-rachel-fuda-rumoured-as-potential-new-rhonj-s13-cast-member.html><span>←</span><span> Melissas friend Rachel Fuda rumoured as potential new RHONJ S13 cast member Wed 25 May 2022</span></a>
