<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Doesnt Want To Lose Her Hollywood Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/justin-bieber-mark-my-words-purpose-album-about-selena-gomez-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2>Justin confirmed that “like three” songs on&nbsp;Purpose are about Selena, and during an interview with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ellen DeGeneres</a></strong>, he admitted that the first two singles, “What Do You Mean?” and “Sorry,” along with this third track, were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>inspired by his gorgeous ex-girlfriend</a>. In “Mark My Words,” he croons about a back-and-forth relationship between a couple that refused to give up on their love, which is exactly what Jelena went through during the tumultuous years they were together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>To hear more about Justin&nbsp;and Selena, head over to iTunes and download the HollywoodLife podcast for free!</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Besides these three songs, we also couldn’t help but notice how “No Pressure” also seems to have a tinge of Jelena to it. The track is one of our favorites on the album, and features Justin singing about how <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he’ll wait for the woman he loves</a>, telling her she shouldn’t feel pressure to get back together right now, and he’ll be there when she’s ready.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The thought of these two rekindling their love seems to be more plausible than ever these days! Although Selena recently admitted she’s “single,” the 21-year-old has said it’s possible they could get back together. “We have a lot of history together, and I’m sure it could possibly happen,” he admitted. “I think we are both just on our own journeys and figuring ourselves out and I think maybe once we figure ourselves out we can come back and make an awesome duo or she finds someone awesome and I find someone awesome. I just want her to be happy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>And, of course, we know the “Good For You” singer is supportive of Justin, too. “Selena is super proud and has congratulated him numerous times on the success of&nbsp;Purpose,”&nbsp;an insider told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY. “She knew how stressed out he was about the reviews, so seeing how well the album has been received makes her especially proud of him. She knows he put his blood, swear and tears into this album.” Awwww! We wonder if she’s heard “Mark My Words” yet?! Check out the lyrics here:</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Mark my words, that’s all that I have<br>Mark my words, give you all I got<br>In every way I will<br>You’re the only reason why<br>Oh I don’t wanna live a lie<br>Mark my words<br>Mark my words</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>So you heard it all before<br>Falling in and out of trust<br>Trying to rekindle us<br>Only to lose yourself<br>But I won’t let me lose you<br>And I won’t let us just fade away<br>After all that we’ve been through<br>I’ma show you more than I ever could say</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Mark my words, that’s all that I have<br>Mark my words, give you all I got<br>In every way I will<br>You’re the only reason why<br>Oh I don’t wanna live a lie<br>Mark my words<br>Mark my words</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think about “Mark My Words”?
