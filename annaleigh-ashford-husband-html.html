Back then, she was on tour with the musical Wicked. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>On the other hand, Tapper was doing his Master of Fine Arts at Yale and was in his third year. He was also bartending on the side to support his acting career.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Annaleigh Ashford and her husband, Joe Tapper posing for a photo.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ashford’s manager, Beth Rosner, played Cupid for the couple. Ashford did not have much of a dating history.</p><p>She wanted to find “the one” for her and settle down for good. Unfortunately, Tapper also didn’t have a good relationship history. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He was skeptical of relationships since he tended to fall for the wrong woman. Therefore, when Rosner arranged a lunch for the two, it did not go quite well.</p><p>Rosner <a href=# rel="follow noopener">believed</a> that once they met each other, they would “illuminate the parts of them that didn't glow as brightly as they could.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They had their first date, but Tapper was unsure if Ashford was the one for him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On the contrary, Ashford found herself liking Tapper. But the two did not go on another date for a long time.</p><p>As if fate was working magic for them, they would occasionally bump into each other. This happened once at a bar and twice on the train.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But still, the two did not talk about going on a second date. As a result, Rosner once again butted in.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She asked Tapper to meet Ashford performing Legally Blonde at the New York Club. He was not a big fan of musical theaters, but still, he went to see her.</p><p>He was impressed with Ashford and her skills. After the musical, they went out to dinner and finally had their second date.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>There, they talked about their lives and their interests. Ashford was interested in Tapper, but the latter was still on the fence.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Annaleigh Ashford and her husband, Joe Tapper, celebrate their son Jack's birthday.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>He canceled on her several times and did not communicate with her well. Finally, he confessed that he was “like an idiot revolting.”</p><p>He admitted it was scary to meet the person he loved who would make him start to grow up. But eventually, Tapper realized that Ashford was the one for her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>And the rest is history.&nbsp;</p><h2>Annaleigh Ashford, Joe Tapper, and Their Son</h2><p>Ashford and Tapper had a ritual of going to Six Flags theme park every year on June 25 to celebrate Ashford’s birthday. Tapper chose her birthday to propose to the actress.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> the proposal as “really funny, not glamorous.” The couple tied the knot in 2013. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They had their wedding ceremony at Devil’s Thumb Ranch in Colorado. The theme was the Old West and theater world combined.</p><p>In 2016, Ashford and her husband were pregnant with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">baby boy</a>. Jack was born on September 8, 2016.</p><p>Ashford often posts pictures of her husband and son on her Instagram, showing off their “happily ever after” life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmeo66tscign2aZo52zsL7DZp%2Buq5KWu6V6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rhocs-noella-claims-estranged-husband-abandoned-their-autistic-son.html><span>←</span><span>RHOC's Noella Claims Estranged Husband Abandoned Their Autistic Son</span></a>
