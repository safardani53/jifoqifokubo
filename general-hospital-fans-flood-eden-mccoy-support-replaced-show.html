My mother has fought an intense battle with cancer for the past 2 and a half years and has now left us physically," Eden continued.</p><p>"I’m not sure what to say other than she was, is, and will be the best thing I have ever known. She is responsible for every good part of me, and she took me with her when she left."</p><p>Eden went on: "Losing my mother has always been my greatest fear, as I’m sure many of you feel the same, and we have this habit as people of thinking that it will never happen to us. Unfortunately it can, and sometimes it does."</p><p>She ended: "My one wish is that we will meet again. You carried me with you for 9 months and now I will carry you forever. I see you everywhere."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'GOD BLESS YOU!'</h2><p>&nbsp;When the news came out that Courtney temporarily replaced Eden, fans flocked to social media to share their support.</p><p>One <a href=#>X</a>, formerly Twitter, user wrote: "She did really good. But, i definitely miss Eden already. She is Josslyn. No one can top her. Can’t wait til she’s ready to come back. God bless you E and I know your beautiful mama is smiling down at you #GH."</p><p>"Temp Joss did really good. But I can’t wait for Eden to be back. She is Josslyn!" said another.</p><p>A third added: "Hope our lovely Eden is feeling well - it’s very understandable she needs time to herself to grieve, I’m glad #GH is giving this sweet angel that. It’s not easy losing a parent especially so young, my heart is with her. Glad we have a temp until our real Joss comes back! #JEX."</p><p>"Kudos to the actress for doing a decent job while Eden was on bereavement leave," said another.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Just saw that there is a temp Joss.
