After the 26-year-old revealed&nbsp;she’d been fired by MTV’s parent company Viacom, allegedly for filming the live porn video, <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> has EXCLUSIVELY learned that a lot of Farrah’s fans were upset with how the film went. In fact,&nbsp;the fans who tuned into watch felt so let down by the show that CamSoda, the porn website that hosted the show, EXCLUSIVELY told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com&nbsp;</strong>that they had to address the situation with viewers…and even offer a refund.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“Based upon reports in the media, Farrah Abraham was fired from MTV, allegedly for her Oct. 30th performance on CamSoda. Farrah is a strong independent businesswoman, it is reprehensible that she would lose her job because of a webcam performance,”&nbsp;CamSoda’s vice president <strong>Daryn Parker</strong> told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com&nbsp;</strong>EXCLUSIVELY. “We wish Farrah the best and are looking forward to seeing her next successful venture.” However, Daryn went on to explain that, even though CamSoda does&nbsp;not support Farrah being fired, the company&nbsp;does have to look out for its viewers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“That being said, CamSoda values all members of its community, and we pride ourselves on being the premier live cam site,” the statement read.&nbsp;“Farrah’s live cam show on Monday night left many fans disappointed. Some have reached out because her social media promotion leading up to the show created unfulfilled expectations. I want to be vehemently clear and say that all users have received a full refund for all the tokens they spent on Farrah’s show.” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>See pics of Farrah here!</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>We also EXCLUSIVELY found out why fans felt they deserved a refund for the show. “Farrah did not perform anal as planned and promoted. Instead, she was dressed in lingerie and used the time during the show to promote her anal products and vocalize her displeasure with MTV’s decision,” a source close to CamSoda told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com </strong>EXCLUSIVELY&nbsp;“To clarify, since she didn’t perform anal as we promoted, fans who spent money were refunded.” Wondering how Farrah feels about all of this?
