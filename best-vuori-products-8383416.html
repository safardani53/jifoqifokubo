As Sakelliou says, “Vuori products are functionally designed to transcend traditional boundaries and blur the lines between fitness and life.” And, yes, they are famous for those super-soft, versatile joggers you’ve heard all your friends talk about, but the brand has plenty of other viral-worthy products, including its new outerwear offerings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aiming to provide these functional pieces to anyone and everyone who leads an active lifestyle, Vuori hopes to stand out in the market as something much more than just a brand, but rather “a way of life,” as Sakelliou<strong> </strong>says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for some of the brand’s most popular pieces and what makes them special.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vuori-performance-jogger></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Performance Jogger</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vuori Womens Performance Jogger" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/2NqgL42nn6z0vr_RxFE0vQulgH0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vuori-womens-performance-jogger-ee2528b832d445a1bba88c4996a66f42.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vuori</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, these are the infamous joggers that you haven’t stopped hearing about for what feels like two years now. Available in 17 colorways, it’s easy to imagine how you could create an entire collection of these joggers, which could easily transition from lounging and errands to beyond. It’s easy to picture them styled with an oversized hoodie and chunky socks for movie night at home, or with a crop top and leather jacket for a casual date night. What’s more, they have nearly 30,000 (yes, thirty thousand) reviews and an average rating of 4.8 stars. One reviewer even mentioned they had bought six pairs. Personally, any item that would inspire someone to buy six times over (especially when that item retails at $94) is worth checking out in our book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>89% recycled polyester, 11% elastane | <strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, Black Heather, Cosmo Heather, Heather Grey, Ruby Heather, and more</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vuori-canyon-insulated-jacket></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Canyon Insulated Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vuori Canyon Insulated Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/gWkeb26RJWijKC-0V74eGTKyt3w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Vuori-Canyon-Insulated-Jacket-b8fc27e6656441babe5cd3a077df8381.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vuori</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A lightweight insulated jacket is a must-have in transitional seasons like fall and spring — and the Canyon Insulated Jacket is versatile enough to wear with everything from your favorite pair of leggings to high-waisted jeans and your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite fall boots</a>. This jacket is constructed from recycled polyamide and elastane, so it has a little bit of stretch to it. It comes in three colors (pistachio green, hazel brown, and black) and its slouchy fit gives it an overall effortless look. In addition to style and comfort, the jacket is also functional for weather and features a PFC-free DWR coating, giving it a water-resistant finish to protect you from the elements.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>85% recycled polyamide, 15% elastane; polyester/elastane lining | <strong>Size Range: </strong>XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Pistachio, hazel, black</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vuori-mens-ponto-performance-yoga-pants></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Men's Ponto Performance Yoga Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ponto Performance Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/GNmuj3dJWL1V0NUiBXLRKnRQMWw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ponto-performance-pants-b46cf68b99d0447890e2af0a887307ad.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Vuori may be known for its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best-selling women’s joggers</a>, but the brand also offers men's apparel (it was created by a man, after all). The men’s performance pants come in at $98 and are available in nine different shades. Like the joggers, they’re the perfect balance of comfortable and functional —&nbsp;ideal for going from lounging to working out to traveling without looking like you’re wearing pajamas. Honestly, these would be a great gift for those ultra-picky husbands this holiday season.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>89% recycled polyester, 11% elastane | <strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Charcoal Heather, Heather Grey, Black Heather, Oregano Heather, Midnight Heather, Indigo Heather, Kelp Heather, and more</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vuori-rib-studio-short></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Rib Studio Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vuori Rib Studio Short" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/75AJbzA_Jsl24yeHF8Vo1ZLXfEc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vuori-rib-studio-short-8ff35b28f456487982b33fb8ac4f8387.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vuori</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve ever tried to find your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>perfect pair of bike shorts</a>, you probably know just how much of a struggle the process can be. They’re either too thin, too restrictive, too short, not high-waisted enough, or don’t hold up well when working out. Finding a pair of high-waisted, bike-style shorts that will look and feel good while working out and going out is virtually impossible, but these popular Ribbed Studio Shorts from Vuori might just do the trick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Again, these shorts have reviews from verified customers who claim to have bought them in multiple colors, which is always a good sign.

This Yosemite bra is not only available in a variety of colors, but provides just the right amount of coverage and support, meaning you can wear it for as long as you want without feeling like you’re suffocating. If you’re feeling a sexier look, the strappy back is a fun detail to show off. And if not, adding an off-the-shoulder sweatshirt on top or throwing on an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>oversized shacket</a> is the perfect way to add a bit more coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>72% polyester, 28% elastane | <strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Pool Blue, White, Black Camo, Ruby, Cosmo, Cactus, Oxford</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vuori-mens-kore-short></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Kore Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vuori Kore Short" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ASnmQEo1pt9YK1oT9tzUMFA2LXg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vuori-kore-short-df6a4c957bb04fbfaf65f58fab2ccc87.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vuori</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a reason — well, reasons — why these shorts have more than 13,000 reviews and a 4.8 average rating. Not only are these available in both 5-inch and 8-inch inseam options, but they also come in a whopping 17 color options, include a boxer-brief liner, and are made of a stretchy, soft-weight fabric that works without rather than against you. For men that hate brief liners or want a short that makes it possible to both go commando and look put together, these are a great choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>46% recycled polyester, 44% polyester, 10% elastane | <strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Indigo, Black, Charcoal, Black Watercolor Camo, Light Cloud, Platinum Linen Texture, Currant, Chestnut, Dusty Pine, Penny Stripe, and more</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vuori-stride-legging></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Stride Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vuori Stride Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qWsXeOvn8dGC44j0VUn_NwV1ZMI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vuori-stride-legging-chestnut-b8d19f5250354530849738f583902989.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vuori</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are technically running leggings, but they can easily transition into lounging or any other casual plans you might have on your schedule. They also have the two features that are, in my opinion, the hallmarks of truly supreme leggings: Stash pockets and a 7/8 length. In my experience, this length looks especially good on everyone and is perfect for transitioning between seasons in multiple colors — so if you like one, you can collect them all. (From our research, this seems to be a recurring theme with Vuori customers). These leggings also feature four-way stretch, UPF protection, and are moisture-wicking, so you can count on staying comfortable, dry, and protected when wearing them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>70% polyamide, 30% elastane | <strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Chestnut, Dark Luna, Ink, Black, Oregano Splatter</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vuori-halo-performance-hoodie-20></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Halo Performance Hoodie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vuori Halo Performance Hoodie 2.0" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XEseUkEJy-HxrtkWHgYoNV_1ciQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vuori-halo-performance-hoodie-20-14c7dc72d27c41d18b25b937b29bedae.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vuori</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What goes into making the perfect hoodie can be a controversial topic to tackle. For some, it’s all about softness; For others, it’s fit. In other circles, it’s all about the zipper versus pull-over debate, or whether or not it has pockets. Not only is the Halo Performance Hoodie as soft as it gets, but it also has strength and wicks away moisture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In other words, it’s the ideal item for throwing on after a particularly sweaty workout class.
