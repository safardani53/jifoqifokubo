He moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. Reyn admitted in a 2021 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Photobook Magazine</a>&nbsp;that he misses Hawaii. “I am happy that I moved, but sad because I can’t see my best friend every day at school or go to the restaurants that I love and visit the beautiful beach,” he said.</p><h2>He started acting the age of 9.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Reyn said in the Photobook&nbsp;interview&nbsp;that his “acting journey started” when he was 9 years old and went to a workshop in Los Angeles. &nbsp;He got booked for a commercial after his very first audition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Reyn-Doi-5-things-that-90s-show-embed2.jpg><h2>He did a movie with Kristen Wiig.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Reyn’s breakout role was the 2021 comedy flick Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, where he starred opposite <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kristen Wiig</strong></a>.

I had a blast,” Reyn said. “Being able to work with Kristen Wiig and <strong>Annie Mumolo&nbsp;</strong>and other different actors… I feel that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”</p><h2>He’s also a dancer.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Reyn is passionate about dancing just as much as he is about acting. In fact, he landed his first commercial gig because of his dance skills. “I’ve always loved dancing because I love grooving and vibing to the music,” he told&nbsp;Photobook Magazine. “I feel like a part of me has always been a dancer. I will always love both dancing and acting,” Reyn added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K%2FpsXNZpuooV1qfXGFj3BraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-pete-rock-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Pete Rock Dating Now</span></a>
