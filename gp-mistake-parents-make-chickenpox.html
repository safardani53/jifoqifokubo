It cools the skin (which feels nice at first), but can then dry it too (eurgh!)!"</p><p>Dr Ranj also added that the use of ibuprofen should be avoided unless medically advised.</p><p>This is because ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory medication, which can react with chickenpox, making them go deeper into the skin tissue.</p><p>NHS guidance states: "Do not use&nbsp;ibuprofen&nbsp;unless advised to do so by a doctor, as it may cause serious skin infections".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Dr Ranj also revealed his top tips on what parents should be looking out for when it comes to chickenpox and how it should be treated.</p><p>He said that chickenpox is caused by a virus and that because of this, antibiotics won't help unless the spots become infected.</p><p>He explained that parents should look out for classic red/blistery/scabby spots, that your children complain are 'really itchy'.</p><p>"Chickenpox is usually better in 1-2 weeks- you're infectious from two days before until all spots have scabbed over," he explained.</p><p>In order to treat chickenpox, the NHS says first you need to check that this is what the spots actually are.</p><p>Official guidance states that an itchy, spotty rash is the main symptom of chickenpox and that it can be anywhere on the body.</p><p>The illness happens in three stages, with the first being the appearance of small spots which spread or stay in a small area.</p><p>The spots will then become blisters which are very itchy and then could burst.</p><p>The third and last stage is that the blisters then become scabs, with some being flaky and others leaking fluid.</p><p>Other symptoms that could appear both before and after the rash appears include a high temperature, aches and pains and generally feeling unwell and a loss of appetite.</p><p>While it's more common in kids, adults can also get chickenpox and for kids, they will likely feel miserable - even if they only have a few spots.</p><h2 id=treat-it>TREAT IT</h2><p>In order to treat chickenpox, Dr Raj recommended the below remedies:</p><ul><li>stay hydrated (jelly & ice lollies are great for this)</li><li>paracetamol for pain/fever (avoid ibuprofen & aspirin unless medically advised)</li><li>use anti-itch medicine/cream (e.g Eurax, Poxclin, antihistamines - avoid calamine lotion as it is drying!)</li><li>try oatmeal in the bath using cool water (pat the skin dry afterwards)</li><li>use cool wet flannels/cooling gels on the skin</li><li>trim nails/use mittens to reduce scratching</li></ul><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"Get medical advise if your child is getting worse, they are under three months, or you are pregnant.</p><p>"Chickenpox vaccine is not routine in the UK currently and is only available privately", he added.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxyhI9qbWtwZGS0sXnMoqqtmZuaerGt0Z6lratdoq6ssYycn6Kbm5q7sbvXaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./golda-meir.html><span>←</span><span>Golda Meir</span></a>
