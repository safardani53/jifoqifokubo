Of the women interviewed, Woods spent money on only one:</p><p>Loredana Jolie Ferriolo (above), a Playboy model and hooker he met through madam Michelle Braun, went on $15,000 shopping sprees and charged everything to him.</p><p>Guess when you’re paying for the sex anyway …</p><p><strong>A degenerate gambler</strong></p><p>Woods’ preferred place to stay in Las Vegas was the Mansion at the MGM Grand, where a one-bedroom suite costs $5,000 per night and he’d gamble in the exclusive VIP casino nearby. According to a source known as Robin Hood 702:</p><p>“Sometimes the only people were me, Tiger Woods, and Michael Jordan. Each of us sat at a private table and played big. Tiger plays big. Up to 30 grand a hand … when you’re playing splits and doubles, you can have 150 grand on one hand.”</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span><strong>Tiger’s enablers<br></strong><p>Woods said in recent interviews that no one in his inner circle knew about his affairs. Come on. Jamie Jungers says, “Every time I would fly out to see [Tiger] or schedule itineraries or anything, I would always go through <a href=#>Bryon Bell</a>.”</p><p>If you believe <a href=#>Joslyn James</a>, she also went through Bryon.</p><p>According to another mistress, Lawton (pictured), when she alerted Tiger to the fact that The National Enquirer had caught on to their affair, he put her in contact with his agent, Mark Steinberg, who allegedly replied, “We’ll take care of it.”</p><p style=text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:center>Tiger Woods cannot be stopped when he pursues something he wants, such as major golf championships or intercourse with Mindy Lawton at 5:30 in the morning.</p><p><strong>A dirty individual</strong></p><p>Lawton says she met Woods at 5:30 one morning before he had to leave for a tournament. She was menstruating, but he insisted on having sex with her, and when the key card to his office didn’t work, he drove to a nearby parking lot.</p><p>There, they had sex in his car.</p><p>After they left, Lawton claims, reporters from The Enquirer picked up the tampon she had dropped in the parking lot and threatened to use it as part of a story.</p><p>“That’s when the cover-up, happened,” Lawton recalled, referring to Tiger’s people agreeing to have him give an exclusive interview to the Enquirer‘s sister publication Men’s Fitness in exchange for the story of their affair being scrapped.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2poX2WAcMDIoJyrZaekvKW%2FjKKqZpldmbazwNhmmqGdkaXArK3TnmSmoaOpv6a%2F0p6qZquRrnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-8-cast-picture.html><span>←</span><span>The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 8 Cast Picture</span></a>
