She is just a Tony Award away from <a href=#>becoming an EGOT winner</a>, with an Emmy, a Grammy and an Oscar already under her belt.</p><p>Cher rose to stardom in 1965 as half of the duo Sonny & Cher with <a href=#>Sonny Bono</a>, her future husband and Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour costar. Together, they recorded hit singles including “I Got You Babe” and “The Beat Goes On.” The couple welcomed a child named <a href=#><strong>Chaz Bono</strong></a> in 1969, the same year they divorced. Sonny died at the age of 62 in a tragic skiing accident in January 1998. Cher later welcomed her second son, <a href=#><strong>Elijah Blue Allman</strong></a>, in 1976 with then-husband<a href=#> Gregg Allman</a>, from whom she ultimately split in 1979.</p><p>Though Cher made some solo material in the ‘60s, she did not find <a href=#>worldwide success on her own</a> until the 1971 release of her album Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves. By the mid-‘70s, her discography boasted hits such as “Half-Breed” and “Dark Lady.” The following decade, she embraced more of a rock vibe in her music with songs including “I Found Someone” and “If I Could Turn Back Time.” Her success in the industry continued through the ‘90s, ‘00s and 2010s, thanks to “Believe,” “Strong Enough” and “Woman’s World.”</p><p>As an actress, Cher garnered critical acclaim for her roles in Silkwood (1983), Mask (1985) and <a href=#>Moonstruck </a>(1987), the latter of which landed her a best actress Oscar. More recently, she starred alongside <a href=#><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a> in <a href=#>Burlesque</a> (2010) and had a cameo in <a href=#>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again </a>(2018).</p><p class=p1>“I’m shocked, but she’s really good. The other day, we were hamming it up so badly, so old, like vaudevillian,” the “Dirrty” songstress <a href=#>gushed to&nbsp;<i>Entertainment Tonight&nbsp;</i>in February 2010</a> of her legendary costar. “She was keeping up! She was hot. Her game is good!”</p><p class=p1>Cher’s personal life has also made headlines throughout her years in the spotlight. After her well-known romances with Sonny and Gregg, she found love again in November 2022 with <a href=#><strong>Alexander “AE” Edwards</strong></a>. Despite <a href=#>their 40-year age gap</a>, the Grammy Award winner <a href=#>frequently defended their connection</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Cher knows full well that there’s a lot of skepticism about this romance but she couldn’t care less,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>at the time</a>. “She’s reveling in the attention and saying that she and AE have something very special going on that’s made her feel more alive and sexier than ever.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>Us&nbsp;</i>later confirmed in May 2023 that <a href=#>the pair had split after six months</a> together. “Their relationship was real and they split a few weeks ago.
