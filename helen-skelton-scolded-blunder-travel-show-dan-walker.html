But Helen made a bit of a blunder as she was describing this part of their adventure to viewers.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON CHANNEL 5">READ MORE ON CHANNEL 5</h2><p>Helen referenced that the tunnel begins in Diggle, which she stated is in <a href=#>Lancashire</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But fans were quick to chime in and tell the star that she was wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>“Great program tonight, but just for clarification, Diggle is in Yorkshire, latterly Greater Manchester but never Lancashire,” one fan pointed out.</p><p>“Loving the show and great to see you having coffee in Uppermill! Just one thing — you said the Standedge Tunnel went from Diggle in Lancashire. It’s not — it’s in Yorkshire — although technically it’s Greater Manchester since 1974,” a second fan confirmed.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Helen was caught out by an old Government act from the 1970s which redrew the borders of several counties. At this time, parts of Yorkshire were reclassified as Lancashire. Diggle actually falls into the Greater <a href=#>Manchester</a> council, but in accordance with the restructuring, it is still classified as historic Yorkshire.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the complicated geography lesson, viewers were very impressed with the show.&nbsp;</p><p>And they’re in for a lot more adventures in the pennines as Dan previously teased what he and Helen have been up to behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the former <a href=#>BBC Breakfast</a> star, the filming process was a bit emotional for the pair as they faced some of their<a href=#> biggest fears</a> for the travel show.&nbsp;</p><p>“I hate heights and I don’t really like horses,” Dan revealed.</p><p>“But I had to abseil down a 100-metre cave and go on the back of a horse, but I’m now best friends with a horse called Roger and I made it to the bottom of the cave,” he teased.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/helen-skelton-filming-pennine-adventure-838306809.jpg><p><strong>Dan & Helen’s Pennine Adventure continues Tuesday at 9pm on Channel 5 and is available for catch up on My5.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpjan5xf5BpZqGdnJq7br%2FKnqOtp55iwKS7y52cnWWSocKvsMSrZK2qkauyrXnSoaawZZSWu27DwKWinqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./primark-game-of-thrones-clothing-collection.html><span>←</span><span>Primark is selling a limited-edition Game of Thrones clothing range priced from just 7</span></a>
