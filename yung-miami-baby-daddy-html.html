But, unfortunately, the 28-year-old couldn't perform over two songs and, consequently, her team had to cancel the show abruptly. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Later, when an entertainment website, The Neighborhood Talk,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared a clip</a> from the show on Instagram, fellow rapper K Goddess empathized with the rapper.
