I am not spiteful. I am not jealous that you have been with another man. I do not own you. You are free. As I said. As I promised. As I truly meant,” Bourdain texted Argento just hours before his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-945504496-1024x698.jpg><p>“But you were careless. You were reckless with my heart. My life.”</p><p>“I can’t take this,” Argento allegedly responded.</p><p>“Is there anything I can do?” Bourdain asked, to which his ex replied, “Stop busting my balls.”</p><p>Bourdain replied simply, “Ok.”</p><p>“I think that’s the last thing he said to her,” Leehsen says of the exchange.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“She kept texting and kept the argument going after that happened but he didn’t respond after that point because I think he was gone. She didn’t know he was gone,” <a href=#>the author tells</a> UK tabloid The Sun.</p><p>“In his last hours he googled a prostitution service and he kept googling Asia.</p><p>“I guess he punished himself by reading over and over and more and more about Asia’s fling with a French journalist in Rome,” Leerhsen continues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/asia-argento-at-cannes-film-festival-741x1024.jpg><p>“He kept googling her name, he googled her 300 times or so in the last few days.”</p><p>Argento has previously addressed allegations that she’s in any way responsible for Bourdain’s suicice.</p><p>“Anthony was 62 (sic), I was 42,” she said shortly after his death.</p><p>“We had lived, we had wives and husbands, we had children,” she continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I cannot think of Anthony as somebody who would make a radical gesture like this for something like that.”</p><p>Leerhsen echoes Argento’s argument that Bourdain’s decision to take his own life was likely motivated by far more than just despair over the end of a romantic relationship.</p><p>“I don’t blame her for what happened to him,” he tells The Sun.</p><p>“Although I think she helped drive him to that place of despair, I don’t think she can be held responsible for his death,” the author adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“In my opinion it was a classic case of almost like a teenage love affair where the boy wants to go steady and the girl doesn’t.”</p><p>Leerhsen went on to clarify that Bourdain appeared to be pressuring Argento into a situation with which she did not feel entirely comfortable.</p><p>“The boy keeps pressing his case and the girl keeps pulling back. “The more the boy expresses his ardor for the girl, the more the girl was turned off,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“That’s what was going on and, whatever you think of her, I think she had every right not be pushed into that kind of relationship.</p><p>Whatever Bourdain was feeling in those final moments, the world lost a unique talent and a vibrant soul on that tragic day in June of 2018.</p><p>Our thoughts go out to his loved ones.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z9cK3NrZ%2Bopqlir7DB0Z2YoqZdqL2mutNmnaKmkaF6qbvUq6pmp5KosrS%2FyKeeZqemmr9usddmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSaq5mWeqK%2Bxp6lraddp7Kxu9GtZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saffron-burrowss-wife-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Saffron Burrows Dating Saffron Burrows's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
