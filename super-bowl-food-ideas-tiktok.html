Ingredients: 16 oz IPA beer 6 cups white cheddar cheese 2 8 oz blocks of cream cheese, softened 2 tablespoons minced garlic 2 tablespoons chives A big sprinkle of cayenne pepper A big sprinkle of salt More chives & cayenne pepper for garnish Pretzel bites (store bought or homemade) Instructions: 1) In a cast iron or deep pan, add cheddar cheese, cream cheese, garlic, chives, beer salt & cayenne pepper. Mix together over medium low flame until cheese is melted. Turn heat down to low and continue to stir until cheese thickens & ingredients fully combine - about 16 minutes. 2) Pour cheese into a large ceramic or serving bowl & sprinkle top with chives & cayenne pepper. Cover with foil while baking pretzels (I feel like this allows the cheese dip to come to the perfect thickness). 3) Once pretzels are done, uncover cheese and serve on a platter. <a title=cheese href=#>#cheese</a> <a title=cheeselover href=#>#cheeselover</a> <a title=appetizer href=#>#appetizer</a> <a title=footballfeast href=#>#footballfeast</a> <a title=superbowl href=#>#superbowl</a> <a title=recipesoftiktok href=#>#recipesoftiktok</a> <a title=recipesforyou href=#>#recipesforyou</a> <a title=recipes href=#>#recipes</a> <a title=beercheese href=#>#beercheese</a> <a title=hosting href=#>#hosting</a> <a title=partyfood href=#>#partyfood</a> <a title=boymomlife href=#>#boymomlife</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - ☆" href=#>♬ original sound - ☆</a></figure><p>This garlic-infused beer cheese will pair perfectly with your "homemade" pretzel bites!</p><p>Add cheddar cheese, cubed, softened cream cheese, minced garlic, chives, beer, cayenne pepper, and salt to a cast iron skillet.
