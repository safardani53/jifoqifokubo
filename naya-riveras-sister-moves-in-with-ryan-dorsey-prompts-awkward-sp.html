You don’t have to deal with being completely alone."</p><p>He also trashed talk that he and&nbsp;Nickayla are involved in any romantic way as "absurd."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Dorsey wrapped u[ his statements by expressing his hope that his video makes people "think twice before they go insert their opinion and jump to conclusions.</p><p>"Think about sending people DM’s wishing death upon strangers who are dealing with so much that they know absolutely zero about."</p><p>Nickayla, meanwhile, wrote the following shortly after her sister’s death was confirmed:</p><p>I’ve never known a life without you in it & still can’t imagine it. My world is turned upside down. But through it all, everything we were, we are still. I’ll always look at you with the same eyes as I did when I was young.⁣</p><p>My shmaya, I’ll love you for eternity & miss you every second of my life.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WGcLrAsphmqpmrsrOt0maqoqukmr9uuc6vnKxlmaN6uLXToWSrsZGjeqW70aycsmWgp7yuvNOsZJqvm6yus7CMrKdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./late-night-hosts-joke-about-orlando-blooms-nude-pics-w433017.html><span>←</span><span>Late-Night Hosts Joke About Orlando Blooms Nude Pics</span></a>
