MrsPreston11 advised: "Go to the manager. I used to work with a compulsive liar.</p><p>"As well as all the bulls*** 'sick' days she stole quite a bit of money from the company before she was caught."</p><p>While Snowydaysarehere wrote: "Def(initely) take it higher, she obviously needs some help."</p><p>And HotelEuphoria agreed, adding: "I would raise your concerns now.</p><p>"She obviously can't keep an imaginary pregnancy going forever but she can feign a miscarriage and whatever sick leave she may get as a result."</p><p>But others thought it would be better to wait and see how it all plays out.</p><p>Shedmicehugh said: "I would leave it, just in case I was wrong. Being accused of faking a pregnancy is quite an accusation. I would let the manager handle it."</p><p>While HairyWorm commented: "It is totally possible that she could have had some issues in early pregnancy and has been vague or given misinformation rather than divulge personal details.</p><p>"Personally, I would probably step back and see how it unfolds as you can't lie about a pregnancy for long."</p><p>And HopefullyAnonymous advised: "I wouldn’t say anything either. If you’re wrong, you’ll look like the crazy one! It will come out in the end if she’s lying."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM MUMSNET</h2></p><p>We recently revealed <a href=# rel=noopener>a strict list of rules a mum-to-be planned to pin to the door for when friends and family visit her newborn baby</a> - and people are outraged.</p><p>While <a href=# rel=noopener>these sisters with EIGHT kids each admit they’re addicted to having babies</a> – and one even kept having kids with her ex because she loves them so much.</p><p>And <a href=# rel=noopener>midwives have been BANNED from saying words like "good girl" and "delivered"</a> - because they are supposedly disrespectful to pregnant woman.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>This unborn baby has the 'rock on' gesture down to a T in cute ultrasound video</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Rubm5tZWZ8rsHMZpicm6WosrR5wqijpZ2RnMKmecWaoqKml2K9s7HGp5inm6lisqK%2F2GapopyVYsSwvspmqqmnpKm2r7OMr5yrsV2ksaV50pyYp2Wgnby1u44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-strahan-salary-gma.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Strahan's Salary for 'GMA' Is Life Goals So What's His Net Worth?</span></a>
