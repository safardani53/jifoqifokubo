Its features were suited to the rockstar’s instrument preferences—the neck humbucker, culled initially from a three-pickup set, produces an out-of-phase sound.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, after collecting enough guitars for a lifetime (or two), it looks like Bonamassa’s collection has finally reached its limit. “I don’t want any more stuff,” he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>I have more guitars and equipment than any other human should ever require or need or want to be in the same room with.</p><p>He also has an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;account where he shares photos of the guitars he owns.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Not just that, Bonamassa also sells a wide range of limited edition guitars and equipment on his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website.</a> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>A Look At His Musical Journey</h2><p>The guitarist was lucky enough to have found his musical inspiration right at home because of his music enthusiast parents, especially his father.</p><p>The New York-born Bonamassa’s parents&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">owned</a>&nbsp;a guitar store, so he had an early exposure to the instrument. As a result, he began playing guitar at the mere age of four. Supported by his parents, he progressed so impressively that by the time he was seven, he could play to the music of famous artists like Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Mentored by Danny Gatton at 11, Bonamassa honed his skills and formed his band at 12, known by the name Smokin’ Joe Bonamassa, and performed gigs on weekends. He also opened for BB King for about twenty shows. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Later he joined a band named Bloodline, through which he grabbed substantial attention as a guitarist. With his first solo studio album&nbsp;A New Day Yesterday, his career took off. Now he has over a dozen solo albums, among which three smashed&nbsp;the Billboard Blues Chart by hitting the number 1 spot along with five more top 10 hits.</p><p>In 2013, his collaboration with SeeSaw got him nominated for the Grammy Awards. His new album,&nbsp;Royal Tea, is another record-breaker that marks his 24th landing on the Billboard Chart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The ‘Breakthrough Artist of the Year’ title winner has rocked the music world with his undeniable talent and dedication towards blues-rock music. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While talking to&nbsp;Guitarist&nbsp;magazine in an interview, he opened up about his musical <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">influences </a>to be British and Irish artists, which shaped him to be one of the industry’s finest guitarists.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Bonamassa Puts His Fortune To Good Use</h2><p>The successful guitarist has piled up an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">estimated</a>&nbsp;net worth of $20 million. No wonder he can afford his expensive guitar and amps collection!</p><p>But it is a known fact that he is a kind-hearted person who doesn’t hesitate to put his money up for charity.&nbsp;</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bonamassa, with other notable artists,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a>&nbsp;a global charity concert event, After Party Showcase, that aimed to donate the collected amount to support pandemic-affected musicians.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Besides that, back in 2014, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">conducted</a>&nbsp;a non-profit charity auction of his show,&nbsp;Joe Bonamassa Show.
