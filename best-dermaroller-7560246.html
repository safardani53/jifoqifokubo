Dermarollers, for those who haven’t yet encountered them, are essentially the at-home (and therefore far milder) version of microneedling; they entail a roller covered in tiny needles that you roll over your skin — all in the name of a smoother, firmer complexion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Dermarolling can provide a multitude of benefits, including reducing acne scars and wrinkles, tightening skin, and smoothing uneven skin texture,” New York City dermatologist Dendy Engelman, MD, tells PEOPLE. “Dermarolling works by tricking the skin into going into regeneration mode by causing micro-injuries on the skin. These tiny wounds induce the production of collagen and elastin, which help improve the appearance of skin and skin healing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of that, “dermarolling can also increase the thickness of your skin and improve product absorption,” says Melanie Palm, MD, a dermatologist in San Diego. That said, it’s not without risk, since the needles are piercing skin, even if superficially; this can introduce bacteria into your skin. "If dermarolling at home, it's important to take the necessary safety precautions and sanitizing measures to prevent infection or damage to the skin,” she says. “I recommend submerging your dermarolling tool in rubbing alcohol for a few minutes prior to using it on your skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because it’s more intensive than, say, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>facial cleansing brush</a>, dermarollers aren’t for everyone. “You don’t want to roll over any active acne or cysts or open wounds,” says New York City-based esthetician Taylor Worden, since that can make matters worse or even transfer bacteria.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similarly, “there is a lot of room for user-error with these devices,” dermatologist Rachel Nazarian, MD, tells PEOPLE. “Applying too much pressure or using it too often can lead to irritation, inflammation, infection or scarring — so be gentle and use infrequently when first adding into <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>your skincare routine</a>. Any bleeding or pain is a sign to discontinue use!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With that in mind, keep scrolling to shop the best dermarollers on the market, according to skin experts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-facegym-faceshot-electric-microneedling-device></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FaceGym Faceshot Electric Microneedling Device</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FaceGym Faceshot Electric Microneedling Device" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/PewxLq0MRjBPLSyG5bnxOyx3jjY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/facegym--faceshot-electric-microneedling-device--1a0ef58883bb4660b54f8124ba4eb0e9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>It’s ideal if you’re worried about hygiene, since the needle tips are single-use, and the addition of the serum can amp up results.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This electric dermaroller does the work for you with the press of a button. Jaimie DeRosa, MD, a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon in Boston, MA and Palm Beach, FL, loves it for two reasons. “The first is that Faceshot comes with medical-grade stainless steel single-use micro-needles,” she says. “This is great because there is little risk of an allergic reaction to the stainless steel and not re-using the same needles helps to decrease risk of infection — the thought of reusing dirty roller needles makes me cringe.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, it also offers a targeted skincare step via a serum that combines glycolic acid and nourishing vitamin E. “It comes with ampoules of serum that go into the skin during the treatment, similar to what we do in the office during a medical-grade microneedling treatment,” Dr. DeRosa says. That said, since it's more intensive than manual dermarollers, there are more considerations to keep in mind when using it — for instance, you pause use for at least two weeks after getting Botox and and four for filler, and those who are pregnant should avoid it altogether because of the serum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Needle length: </strong>0.25 millimeters | <strong>Material: </strong>Stainless steel | <strong>Extra features:</strong> Ampoule infusion</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-sonia-kashuk-microneedle-facial-roller></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sonia Kashuk Microneedle Facial Roller</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sonia Kashuk Microneedle Facial Roller" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/epATjWUcUiX9lAw15gJsP9aHn4U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sonia-kashuk-microneedle-facial-roller-20c6393ff8d5418b9d8cdaaa48a76f81.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Since this is a basic dermaroller, it's not going to include any bells or whistles, if that's what you're looking for.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the wallet-friendly price tag, this dermaroller isn’t that far behind pricier versions, touting smaller needles (which clock in at 0.25 mm) as well as a slim head and stainless steel tips. “Because of the smaller size, it can fit around the curves of the face easily,” says Dr. Nazarian. “It's easy to clean and safer to use due to the shorter needles, which I prefer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you won’t get a ton of bells and whistles with it, it still gets the job done well for a fraction of the cost of other dermarollers. You can use it on both face and neck before applying serum and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a good moisturizer</a> for the best results — and, of course, don’t forget to disinfect it with alcohol in between uses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Needle length: </strong>0.25 millimeters | <strong>Material: </strong>Stainless steel</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-face-and-body-beautybio-glopro-facial-microneedling-tool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Face and Body</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BeautyBio Facial Microneedling Tool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BeautyBio GloPRO Facial Microneedling Tool" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VUrWjilU1N880njpoewp-7Jeehg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BeautyBio-GloPRO-Facial-Microneedling-Tool-ecab4c3cc1cb4c09b8a346c9c1ee5bff.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With 540 stainless-steel microneedles, this tool is no joke. It pairs microneedling with LED red light therapy as well as microcurrent stimulation, which purportedly helps boost collagen production (although the science is iffy) and allow for a deeper improvement, respectively. Those additions make it “perfect for use before a hyaluronic acid serum,” says Mona Gohara, MD, a dermatologist based in New Haven, CT.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, the face attachment can also be swapped out with smaller heads for different needle sizes to accommodate smaller areas, like the eyes and lips, as well as a larger head for the body — which is another reason Dr. Gohara is a fan. “Hello, arms and banana rolls,” she says. The microneedling heads just need to be replaced every three months to keep it hygienic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Needle length: </strong>0.3 millimeters | <strong>Material: </strong>Stainless steel | <strong>Extra features:</strong> LED red light, vibrational microcurrent technology</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-stamp-nurse-jamie-beauty-stamp></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Stamp</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nurse Jamie Beauty Stamp</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermstore Nurse Jamie Beauty Stamp" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/L0vM0JLpf6NGXw9bSXUeSnBtOsA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nurse-jamie-beauty-stamp--ace1ff65aa8e4dcbbdf3052b2fa438e5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since the face is naturally curvy (case in point: cheek and brow bones), it can be tough for some dermarollers to adequately reach smaller, tighter areas. That's what makes this tool, which resembles a small razor, stand out. “I love this for the harder areas to roll, like the upper lip, nose, and above your eyes,” Worden says. “It’s a simple little stamp and all you do is press and lift into the skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That "stamping" action makes it easy for first-timers who want to get a feel for the sensation, as well as offers more precision. You can also use it to press in skincare products, such as serums and face oils, instead of applying them after the fact. That said, there’s no info out there about what kind of metal the needles are made of, so you might not know what you’re working with (and may be too risky for those with sensitive skin).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Needle length: </strong>0.2 millimeters | <strong>Material: </strong>Metal</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-stackedskincare-microneedling-tool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Beginners</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>StackedSkincare Microneedling Tool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="StackedSkincare Microneedling Tool 2.0" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XRmVMBsFaPW0qRpjPcUuA8HIGfg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/stackedskincare-microneedling-tool-20-812c667ed4f048a4a7de4e2b34afee75.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>StackedSkincare</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This dermaroller looks a little different, thanks to a flat handle that's more comfortable to hold. It stands out, however, with its relatively short needles, which clock in at 0.2 mm. That’s a good starting point for newbies, who can work their way up to longer needles if they want (and if their skin likes it) over time. “When shopping for a dermaroller to use at home, I recommend looking for a small needle — think length between 0.2 millimeters and 1 millimeter — especially when just starting out,” says Dr. Engelman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, that short needle length can also keep pain to a minimum and reduce any downtime. “This will reduce discomfort and allow your skin to heal more quickly in between sessions,” she says. The handle is also made of lightweight aluminum, making it easy to control the pressure as you’re working to help you avoid going overboard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Needle length: </strong>0.2 millimeters | <strong>Material: </strong>Stainless steel | <strong>Extra features:</strong> Replaceable roller head</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-advanced-users-ora-face-microneedle-dermal-roller-system-05mm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Advanced Users</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ORA Face Microneedle Dermal Roller System</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermstore ORA Face Microneedle Dermal Roller System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/LIA8Vzp2rrEszHZsow_VbBvnwkw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dermstore-a97a828b8b82470dbbd2f64da4f987f7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re a regular dermarolling fan who wants to take your results to the next level, consider this model. “Different lengths are effective for different skin conditions, but I would not recommend a needle length of longer than 1 millimeter if you're doing this yourself at home,” says Dr. Palm. This one hits a sweet spot of 0.5 millimeters, which is longer than the 0.2- or 0.25-millimeter needles found with beginner-friendly dermarollers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Besides that, the Ora dermaroller also clocks in at a relatively affordable price, making it accessible to most.

The only downside is that the brand doesn’t offer replacement heads for this dermaroller, so once the needles wear down or get dull, you’ll have to toss it and replace it with a brand-new one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Needle length: </strong>0.25 millimeters | <strong>Material: </strong>Stainless steel</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-environ-micro-needling-gold-cosmetic-roll-cit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Environ Micro-Needling Cosmetic Roll CIT</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Environ Micro-Needling Gold Cosmetic Roll CIT" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Y3p_F4NdCZ6ugaR0ivxH1ll8mSw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/environ--micro-needling-gold-cosmetic-roll-cit-d6e2cc03b6cb4af5b4d5e8c4f0315c33.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>La Suite Skincare</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rather than focusing on the length of the needles, this dermaroller focuses on the number of needles in general, with 260 in total. The needles are medical-grade, sharpened one by one, and plated with 14-carat gold, which has natural antibacterial properties. It's designed to be used with Environ skincare products, many of which are available in salons and medical offices, and comes with the brand's Instrument Cleaning Solution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the steep price, the needle length is fairly user-friendly. “The needle length is 0.2 millimeters so it’s great for beginners, and the naturally antibacterial material makes it a more hygienic option,” says Dr. Engelman. Plus, its solid construction means you can use it repeatedly over time, so it’s more of an investment piece anyway. “This roller is so good and if you take care of it properly, it will last you a couple of years,” Worden adds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Needle length: </strong>0.2 millimeters | <strong>Material: </strong>14-carat gold plated</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-best-dermaroller></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Best Dermaroller</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Look for short needles</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to dermarollers, the size matters — a lot. “When looking for a dermaroller, I recommend looking for a needle length of 0.25 millimeters to 1 millimeter,” says Dr. Palm. You can even find shorter options (a few of which are above, including the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Stacked Skincare</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nurse Jamie</a> dermarollers) that have 0.2-millimeter needles.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Consider the material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Stainless steel is preferable since it’s hypoallergenic, so you don’t risk an allergic reaction. Plus, you can clean it with rubbing alcohol and simply reuse without it getting warped or altered in any way. You can also find other types of metals (such as gold, featured in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>La Suite Skincare's Environ Micro-Needling Gold Cosmetic Roll</a>) that offer antibacterial properties. It's worth noting that if a metal isn't specified, you don't know what you're working with and may be more risky to use on sensitive skin.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-2cde8a53-6d23-47d6-ab77-726d4e4ceb93></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.717691342535><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do dermarollers really work?</span></p><p>Yes, so long as you keep your expectations realistic. “While it does not replicate the results of injectables, lasers, or other more invasive treatments, it can be an effective treatment for those who are looking for non-invasive ways to rejuvenate the skin,” says Dr. Palm. Not only that, but just about everyone can benefit from it — although, she says, “it can be particularly effective for those who want to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, mild to moderate acne scars, discoloration, stretch marks, or the overall texture and elasticity of their skin.”<br></p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How often should I use a dermaroller?</span></p><p>It depends on the length of the needles, says Dr. Engelman. “The shorter the length, the more frequently you will be able to use it since it will take less time for the skin to heal from the micro-injuries,” she says. “That being said, even with the shortest needle, dermarolling should only be done at most three times per week.” If you’re working with longer needles, you might want to use it weekly or every few weeks, since skin will need more time to heal between sessions.<br></p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98008849557522><p><span class=accordion__title>What should you not use after dermarolling?</span></p><p>Harsh ingredients post-roll could potentially interfere with the healing process. As a result, “I would not recommend using ingredients that are more irritating and drying initially, such as those with glycolic acid, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinoids</a>, or any acne medication,” says Dr. Nazarian. Instead, opt for soothing formulas and ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid, green tea extract, and others intended to hydrate skin.<br></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word for It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Deanna Pai</a> has been covering beauty and health for over 10 years, writing deeply reported stories on everything from the rise of fermented ingredients in skincare to the merits of intermittent fasting.
