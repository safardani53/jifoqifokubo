Who knew?"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2><strong>'SO EASY!'</strong></h2><p>A third viewer chimed in: "Final Jeopardy mentions Denver, so middle contestant picks east coast capitals?"</p><p>"That was an embarrassing response," another wrote.</p><p>One person reacted: "Final was so easy, especially if you know that odd numbered interstates run north/south. The middle contestant had no business being on the stage. Albany and Boston? What!"</p><p>While some labeled the final question as "so easy," that hasn't exactly been the case lately with other questions.</p><h2><strong>'NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE'</strong></h2><p>Recently, a Final Jeopardy category under Modern Words had a question that read: "Neal Stephenson coined this word in his 1992 novel, Snow Crash. It was later shortened by a company to become its new name."</p><p>The word was metaverse, and was later shortened to Meta, which owns <a href=#>Facebook</a>.</p><p>At the time, a fan tweeted: "Everyone lost final Jeopardy tonight. And folks say the word is oversaturated!"</p><p>Then Neal himself reached out to Ken and wrote: "... These questions are just too obscure. Give these poor people a chance!"</p><p>The 48-year-old responded: "<a href=#>I have no idea who you are</a>, unverified Twitter user, but for your information, Snow Crash is a classic!"</p><p>Even Emma- who won the episode- wrote on <a href=#>Reddit</a> that she even read the book the clue was referring to but <a href=#>couldn't guess it</a>.</p><h2><strong>TIME TO RUNAWAY</strong></h2><p>Ken was to blame recently for a heated debate between fans after the game show legend <a href=#>refused to use a term coined</a> by the late <a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>.</p><p>Contestant Ben Chan, who teaches philosophy at St. Norbert College and lives in Green Bay, <a href=#>Wisconsin</a>, had racked up over $69,000 total with <a href=#>three runaway wins</a> out of three games by April 14's episode.</p><p>However, each time Final Jeopardy came around, Ken didn't state that Ben had achieved a runaway by that point - he instead simply said the player had a "big lead."</p><p>This peeved fans as one wrote: "Why not say runaway?"</p><p>They continued: "I remember when Alex Trebek was hosting, if the first-place player going into Final Jeopardy had more than double what the second-place player had, Trebek would call it a 'runaway' or something similar.</p><p>"It seems that Ken is reluctant to do so. He will often say the player has a 'big lead' or something similar. Has anyone else noticed this? And if so, why?"</p><p>"Is he trying to be nice and not make the other contestants look bad? Has someone said that viewers will be bored and stop watching if the outcome is basically a lock?" they added.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Other fans defended the move as one wrote: "... I get the argument, but I don't think it will affect a game. Also points out to the viewers that the game is essentially over. Not great for ratings!"</p><p>Ben bowed out after his third win, later revealing he was hit with a <a href=#>very mild" case of Covid-19</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/taken-without-permission-headline-say-812422610.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/taken-without-permission-headline-say-812422611.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/alex-trebek-speaks-rehearsal-taping-710946564-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaWqBc4WXaKGep6CWv6XFjJymp6yVqMGiutNmnKaakae%2For%2FSoqWgZZGjwLix0WadoqaRoXqywcSsq6KnnmKwqa3MqaCopl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./haute-living-dinner-jeff-koons-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Haute Living Dinner With Jeff Koons: Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
