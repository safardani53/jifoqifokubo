"Young stunna," the rapper, 33, captioned a father-son photo in which they are all smiles and surrounded by silver and black balloons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The father of one also shared another candid photo of the pair on his Instagram Story, along with an image of Adonis hugging his grandmother Sandi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Adonis' mom, Sophie Brussaux, gave a sweet shout-out to her son on Instagram with a collection of photos, including two pictures from when her child was born at the hospital. "Joyeux anniversaire mon amoureux! 3 years ago, I was finally meeting you for the first time, after a long 24-hr labour," the artist and former adult-film star wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm so proud of the little man you‚Äôre becoming, I love you more than life.

"Happy Birthday to my little pride and joy I love you little guy, you make me very proud to see that you‚Äôre the one to carry on the Graham tradition," he wrote on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Drake confirmed the long-rumored news that he fathered a child with Brussaux on numerous tracks on his double album, Scorpion, which was released in June 2018. "I wasn't hiding my kid from the world/ I was hiding the world from my kid," he said on the track "March 14," publicly addressing his son for the first time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then in March 2018, the hitmaker posted the first photos of his son. Before that, he'd offered glimpses into his life as a dad ‚Äî sharing photos of Adonis' artwork, Father's Day gifts and birthday party decorations ‚Äî but had never any photos of his little boy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, Drake has shared a couple of photos of the toddler this summer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was great to just share that with the world," the proud parent said about his first-ever Instagram post of Adonis during a chat on Lil Wayne's show <a title="(opens new window)" href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Young Money Radio with Lil Wayne on Apple Music</a>.
