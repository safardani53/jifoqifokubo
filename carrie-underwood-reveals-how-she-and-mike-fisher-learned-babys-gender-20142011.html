The country crooner, 31, dished to <a href=#>ABC News Radio</a> this week about her pregnancy with her first child, and how she and husband <strong>Mike Fisher</strong> learned the baby's gender.&nbsp;</p><p>Explaining that the doctor's office is "kind of a sterile place," the Grammy winner said that she and hockey player Fisher, 34, chose not to learn whether their tot will be a boy or a girl in ultrasounds.&nbsp;</p><p>"We got to see all the pictures and everything," she said. "It was really cool to see that, but whenever she'd get near, near those parts we would look away."</p><p>So that they could make the step when they were ready, the happy couple asked their doctor to write the gender of the baby on a slip of paper and put it in an envelope. Underwood and Fisher, who tied the knot in July 2010, went out to a fancy restaurant to celebrate and opened the note there.&nbsp;</p><p>"Just the two of us in a nicer setting, but we both knew," <a href=#>Underwood told ABC</a>. "So, that was just confirming our suspicions. We didn't really speak of it before, 'cause we were both just like, 'Whatever. It's all good.' But we knew it was a boy."</p><p>The "See You Again" singer <a href=#>first announced her pregnancy</a> this past September, sharing a sweet photo of herself with her two dogs dressed in shirts reading, "I'm going to be a big sister" and "I'm going to be a big brother."&nbsp;</p><p>"In honor of 'Labor' Day, Ace & Penny would like to make an announcement," Underwood captioned the shot. "Their parents couldn't be happier…"&nbsp;<a href=#>See adorable pics of Underwood’s growing baby bump.</a></p><p>The baby's gender didn't stay secret for much longer, as <strong><a href=#>Brad Paisley</a></strong> broke the news that <a href=#>Underwood will be the mother to a boy</a> when the pair hosted the CMA Awards together on Nov. 5. Paisley suggested his pal name her baby Garth, and went on to make multiple references to a little boy.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p>&nbsp;<p>Underwood told ABC she was prepared for the slip.</p><p>"Brad's got loose lips," she said. "He's a blabbermouth! So, I was like, 'I'm not gonna tell you until we're ready for the rest of the world to know, 'cause I know you'll tell people.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmaKntqZ51KebnqqnpLyledGerZ6ZnKh6qbvWZqqhnV2Wu6V5zKKinmWWnsCpsdFmo56ZoqOypXnBmpmyq12csq%2BwxKtka2hhaX9xfZBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./0xwgrdxa8-nzkdx3emtig8rwrqiingi5.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Legends of the Hidden Temple Season 3 Episode 34: Episode 114</span></a>
