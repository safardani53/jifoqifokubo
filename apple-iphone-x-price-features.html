The iPhone X's screen covers the whole face while iPhone 8 is more like traditional iPhones with a frame.</p><p>The internal systems for both phones are similar but they do have different displays.</p><p>The iPhone X's is higher quality and is the first Apple phone to switch from&nbsp;an IPS LCD display to an OLED display – the same technology used by Samsung to make its "infinity screens".</p><p>But the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus come with the classic IPS LCD panels.</p><p>The camera is also upgraded on the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X but the standard iPhone 8 will have a regular camera, similar to those of its predecessors.</p><p>The iPhone X will have an additional exclusive feature, with the upgraded front-facing camera being able to achieve similar effects to the portrait mode on the back camera.</p><p>Apple has revealed the price of replacing the<a href=# rel=noopener> device's glossy, edge-to-edge OLED screen - which will cost a whopping&nbsp;£286.44.</a></p><p>That's more than £100 pricier than fitting a new display on the iPhone 8, which will set you back&nbsp;£176.44.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Hands-on with the new iPhone X at Apple's launch event with The Sun's Dan Jones</span><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest news on Apple tech</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2cnKBfaYF2gJdxaGiZoKW5pnnIqZ%2BoppVixW680aKanmWWmq61wdGeqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-maria-alberghetti-19360515-html.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Maria Alberghetti (Opera Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
