The Irreplaceables’ moms wanted this to be the thing that defined them for being away from Abby.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/abby-lee-miller-is-the-worst-674x1024.jpg><p>They wanted to achieve a win without the influence of her. Things did not get much better when Aisha showed up to find that the girls were still defying her.&nbsp;</p><p>She thinks the girls are struggling because they do not know much about how the industry works.</p><p>This was not exactly what they wanted to hear, and it caused a lot of drama for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Kira took issue with the way Aisha was talking about everyone and felt like she was too hard on them.</p><p>In reality, Aisha wanted them to be a success because it would look bad on her if they did not.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/abby-lee-miller-is-the-worst-674x1024.jpg><p>Aisha then took aim at Kalani for not paying attention to what she was saying.</p><p>She worried that the girls would not be able to separate themselves from the pack if they went to an audition without their mothers.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Abby appeared to speak to the ALDC mothers and went on another screaming session about how she made all of the others a lot of money by letting them be a part of her team.&nbsp;</p><p>But, why is she blaming them when she’s clearly the one who cannot handle having some money without causing some drama for herself?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Things then went into overdrive when Abby bickered with a producer because she did not want to be in the audience to face the other mothers and disappears.&nbsp;</p><p>While Abby is hiding in the shadows, everyone learns the ALDC is doing "Where Have all the Children Gone?" and everyone seemed mad about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Things took another epic turn when the mothers threw sass at one another and went as low as trashing their daughters. The Irreplaceables take second place proving they are not the force they were with the ALDC.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When does Abby Lee Miller really leave?
