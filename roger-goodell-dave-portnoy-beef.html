He planned to distribute them to fans at that night’s NFL kick-off game which was the New England Patriots vs. the Kansas City Chiefs at Gillette Stadium. The image, which was already on a Barstool t-shirt, reportedly annoyed the NFL commissioner in the past, so Dave truly wanted to annoy him as best he could.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He was successful that night, and there were tens of thousands of neon blue towels throughout the stadium with Roger’s cartoon face and a clown nose on them.
