Esposito replied in the comments with a simple, "Ha."</p><p>Yes, that’s all it took.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The internet ran with Esposito’s monosyllabic commentary to the point that she was forced to issue a clarification.</p><p>"I literally laughed at [Spade] because he was so bold in what he was saying and I thought it was funny," an incensed Esposito explained.</p><p>"I’m allowed to think something is funny."</p><p>She added:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"We have so many things in our country and in our world that need attention, and I wish that you’d spend even a minute of this insanity of nonsense on things that are really important."</p><p>Esposito went on to say that she didn’t even watch the Oscars and has no interest in who her ex is … dueting with.</p><p>"I didn’t watch the Oscars, I don’t know what went on, I don’t care what went on," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I just commented on something that I thought was funny."</p><p>So perhaps Jen really didn’t intend to throw any shade.</p><p>And if she were the only one dropping hints on social media, perhaps Gaga-gate would be a thing of the past.</p><p>But as it happens, Irina Shayk unfollowed Gaga on Twitter and Instagram just days before the Oscars.
