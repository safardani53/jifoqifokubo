The incident took place at Southwell on Saturday where her horse Mukha Magic was ridden by apprentice Oisin McSweeney.
The five-year-old horse could only manage third in the race, but his trainer Kelleway clearly believed McSweeney could have done better.
The pair were called in by the stewards after the race after two fellow riders witnessed an incident between Kelleway and McSweeney in the unsaddling area."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
