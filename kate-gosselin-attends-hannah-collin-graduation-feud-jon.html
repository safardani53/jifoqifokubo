They’ve all been through a lot these past few years so it was a really nice family celebration.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>“Jon and the kids arrived at the graduation in Collin’s brand new convertible Mustang. They were all smiles and ready to graduate.&nbsp; Collin and Hannah looked like best friends.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jon wanted it to be a day to remember and threw a huge BBQ cooking up a storm. Friends and family came to celebrate.&nbsp;Jon’s mother also came to celebrate."</p><p>The inside added: “Kate showed up, which was a bit of a surprise, considering she truly has been missing for most of Collin's adult life and barely has seen Hannah.</p><p>“Jon’s ex Colleen, who has remained close to the kids, came to see them graduate and surprisingly sat directly behind Kate.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jon and Colleen have remained friends and he was happy to see her. It was a bit intense for Jon having both his ex-girlfriend and ex-wife there, but everyone was civil and the kids were the number one priority.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jon and Kate did not speak at all - she was sat at the opposite end of the place and they didn’t have to see each other. Although Colleen sat right behind Kate and that was a very strange sight! They didn’t even look at one another.</p><p>It was a bit intense for Jon having both his ex-girlfriend and ex-wife there, but everyone was civil and the kids were the number one priority."</p><p>“Jon knew Kate was coming because she and Hannah have spoken a few times and she said she would be there.</p><p>“Kate and Collin are still not talking, but she saw him graduating too as it was at the same time as Hannah.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jon was surprised that Kate had decided to come just because she has been absent for a lot of their lives, so he wasn’t expecting that she’d show up to graduation.”</p><h2>RECONNECTION</h2><p>Jon previously revealed how <a href=#>Hannah reconnected with her mom</a> and the siblings in her care <a href=#>Alexis, Leah, Joel and Aaden</a> on the sextuplets' 19th birthdays.</p><p>While Hannah spoke with her estranged family members, Jon told The U.S. Sun he, unfortunately, was&nbsp;<a href=#>unable to talk to his other four kids on their birthday</a>.</p><p>Jon did wish them well on social media, as he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">captioned a photo of the sextuplets</a>: "HAPPY 19th BIRTHDAY to all my Kids!! I love you all so much!!"</p><p>Back in May he also revealed he <a href=#>wouldn't be attending</a> his other kids' graduations.</p><h2>'I'LL NEVER GIVE UP'</h2><p>But he says the door is always open when it comes to having a relationship with the four sextuplets, and twins Mady and Cara, 22.</p><p>“I will never give up trying to talk to my children. I’m hoping with social media that maybe they might reach out to me at some point," he told The U.S. Sun in a previous interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The door is always open to rekindle any kind of relationship. I've tried for years for any interaction with any of my other kids, but nothing yet.”</p><p>The former&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jon & Kate Plus 8</a>&nbsp;stars were involved in a nasty custody battle through the years that ended when the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">children</a>&nbsp;turned 18.&nbsp;</p><h2>CUSTODY BATTLE OVER</h2><p>Jon previously told The U.S. Sun of how it feels for the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">14-year court war to come to an end</a>: "I'm in a pretty euphoric place right now.</p><p>“It's finally over, I don't have to deal with her, with court hearings, lawyers - it's done. I can get on with my life, it's such a good feeling. I don't even think it's sunk in yet because I've been going to court for so long.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"The thing in these cases is that there's no winning. The only winners are the lawyers. The kids always lose out- it's not a soccer match, there's never a winner.</p><p>"But now I'm finally moving on with my life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/gosselin-graduation-822965923.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/jon-kate-plus-8-promo-673958631-5.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYm6Dd4OVaKKarJVitLC%2F0p6joqZdlsG1sc2dqmagkaO7orSMnKalpJmjeqi%2BwJ2smqyZpLtussSum2ain6N8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-cannon-id-rather-my-daughter-be-like-bhad-bhabie-than-kylie.html><span>←</span><span>I'd Rather My Daughter Become Cash Me Ousside Girl!
