Umansky is also stepfather to Farrah, 35, whom Richards shares with ex-husband <strong>Guraish Aldjufrie</strong>.</p><p>Prior to revealing their Christmas plans, Richards and Umansky <a href=#>spent Thanksgiving together</a>. The realtor shared a video of the celebration, which included his estranged wife.</p><p>“OK, the turkey has been cut and it has been cooked. Let me see it. Can you lift up the turkey?” he asked in an Instagram Story video that showed Richards lifting the tops off various chafing dishes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kyle-Richards-Plans-to-Spend-Christmas-With-Maurico-Umansky-and-Their-Kids.jpg><p>During an October episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Richards said she and Umansky are still <a href=#>living together</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Us Weekly</a> confirmed in July that Richards and Umansky had separated after 27 years of marriage. They have since clarified that they have not yet taken steps to make their split official.</p><p>“I misspoke on the red carpet today,” Richards said during the November 6 episode of WWHL. “Two times I had to correct someone when they said ‘divorce.’ I said ‘separated.’ And then I went and said it, and then it went everywhere. So, that was my bad.”</p><p>A source exclusively told Us last month that the pair have not made any moves to start the divorce process.</p><p>“Kyle and Mauricio <a href=#>have not hired attorneys</a>, nor have either of them filed yet,” the source said. “While they are separated, they want to keep their lives as normal as possible for the kids.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When and if they do decide to file, neither of them will be bitter or coming after the other,” the insider added, noting that there’s “a lot of tension” between the former couple but “they don’t wish bad on the other” going forward. “Neither of them wants a long and vengeful divorce.”</p><p>Richards’ sister <strong>Kathy Hilton</strong> said that she doesn’t expect the couple <a href=#>to get back together</a>. “There’s no way Kyle would’ve gone this far unless she really thought about it,” Hilton, 64, shared with Today on November 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyaerO1wqGYq5yjYsSquMtmqqmdnpl6pLTRoqqtpZGoeri106Fkppmlp7aktc5mrKaZnqi4uns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-momsen.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Taylor Momsen net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
