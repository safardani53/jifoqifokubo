Is there any other kind of chap?)</p><p>There were other developments, of course, including Snooki getting so plowed there were times when it looked like we were about to witness a death by alcohol poisoning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/ronni-967x1024.png><p>But the big drama of the night came when Ronnie Ortiz-Magro decided to ask Jenni Farley about her relationship.</p><p><a href=#>Farley was going through a divorce</a> at the time and clearly had no interest in discussing the matter with Ron — or anyone, for that matter.</p><p>And yet, he persisted — operating under the logic that if she had such strong opinions about his tumultuous <a href=#>relationship with Jen Harley</a>, then her relationship should be fair game, as well.</p><p>"That’s how you fell in love, right?" Ron asked Jenni referring to Mike and Laurens.</p><p>"I don’t want to be on camera with this," said an unusually taciturn JWoww.</p><p>"It’s already out there, so just…" he replied.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/10/rahhhhn.png><p>"We don’t talk about it here, though," she promptly interrupted.</p><p>It may seem a bit unbalanced, but Jenni may have made it clear that her relationship was off-limits for her discussion on the show, which makes Ron quite the d-bag for pursuing it.</p><p>"You acting like you feel nothing? That doesn’t work for nobody ever," he later said while opening up to Angelina, of all people.</p><p>"Like, when me and Jen [Harley] fight, and she acts like — that makes me more mad. You know? Be real."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In the midst of a full-on Ron-page and egged on by Angelina, he continued.</p><p>"Stop acting like you’re not hurting. That’s what I’m saying. Stop acting like you’re not hurting," Ron said.</p><p>"There’s no way that this man is — I know what he’s going through. To be with somebody that’s so cold and shows no emotion and is just so — and all you do is give and give and give, like, it hurts."</p><p>And in a confessional segment at the end of the show, Ron hit us with this kicker:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"That’s why me and Roger [Mathews] are so close ’cause we’ve been dealing with the same person."</p><p>To be fair, this was before <a href=#>Jenni accused Roger of abuse</a>, but it was still out of line.</p><p>In fact, it made us rewind to the scene where Ronnie busted his ass running from a wasp in order to enjoy that slapstick 18 more times.</p><p>Dude had it coming!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Jen Harley: What Arrest??
