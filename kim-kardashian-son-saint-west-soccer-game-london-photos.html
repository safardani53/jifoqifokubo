In the first slide, the 42-year-old puckered up and posed in her iconic kissy face, while she rocked a black leather <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bikini top</a>. The second and third slides showed Kim posing in another part of her house with a sultry nude lip and loose beach waves. “The iPhone’s shadow is such art,” one fan gushed in the comments, while another added, “Why are there so many haters??? Just admire her she looks amazing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Earlier this week,&nbsp;The Kardashians&nbsp;star skipped out on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oscars after-parties</a>, but rocked a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>snakeskin top</a> the next day. “Have the best day!”, she captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sexy selfie</a>.
