<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Kristina Rihanoff Had To Apologize Over Her Controversial Tweets As Netizens Retaliated</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Kristina Rihanoff</strong>, a professional on Strictly Come Dancing from 2008 to 2015, apologized on Twitter after receiving widespread criticism for her inflammatory statements regarding the current Russia-Ukraine issue.&nbsp;The dancer attracted outrage over a now-deleted series of tweets, one of which criticized Sky News for stating that Russia had been barred from participating in Eurovision after the situation last weekend.</p><h2>Kristina Rihanoff was forced to apologize as netizens retaliated.</h2><p>Kristina Rihanoff started her apologies by explaining that “much more essential information was available on that day” than the Eurovision update.</p><p>“I made fun of Sky’s Eurovision tweet.” On that day, I thought there was considerably more essential information than Eurovision. This in any way implies that I was endorsing what is now going on between Russia and Ukraine.”</p><p>She said that she had Ukrainian ancestors and gave her daughter a Ukrainian name, saying:</p><p>“It’s really upsetting for someone like me, who has a grandfather from Ukraine and gave my daughter Milena a Ukrainian name.” My closest buddy is from Ukraine as well. I grew up with the understanding that we were one nation and one country.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kristina-Rihanoff-1.jpg alt="Kristina Rihanoff" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kristina Rihanoff, who is “not into politics” and despises politicians, went on to say:</p><p>“I’m not interested in politics and despise politicians because THEY ALL LIE.” Seeing the news breaks my heart since I have Russian friends in Ukraine and vice versa.”</p><p>The dancer stated of the losses on both sides, “There are casualties on both sides.”</p><p>“The terrible part is that there will be losses on both sides, and on both sides, mothers and fathers will mourn for their dead family.” The point is that this should never have occurred in the first place.”</p><p>She also said that the conflict is a “profitable enterprise,” writing:</p><p>“The nation leaders should have found a method to resolve this amicably a long time ago, but they didn’t because war is a successful industry, and someone is tragically profiting from it.”</p><p>Rihanoff, an American citizen who opposes “Putin, war, invasion, lost lives, and politics,” declared that she had no intention of offending anybody and was “truly sorry” for her conduct.</p><p>“I oppose Putin, war, invasion, lost lives, and politics.” I despise it as much as a human being can. If I upset anybody, that was not my aim, and I apologize profusely. “I was born in Russia but emigrated 22 years ago to become an American citizen.”</p><p>Kristina Rihanoff wrote, noting that she is helpless to aid anybody in either country:</p><p>“So you may hate me if it brings you comfort, but if I didn’t say whatever you wanted me to say, it’s because I’m helpless to assist anybody in either country, and I don’t believe in meaningless postings that don’t help save lives.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kristina-Rihanoff-2.jpg alt="Kristina Rihanoff" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She ended her remarks by saying she would continue praying as the globe burned throughout the crisis.</p><p>“All I can do is hope and pray that this is all over quickly.” And it’s just tragic that hatred is so pervasive right now. “The whole planet is burning inside of it.”</p><h2>Here’s what triggered Kristina Rihanoff’s outrage.</h2><p>Kristina Rihanoff went to Twitter last week to convey that she is more concerned with her family’s company, which has been severely damaged by the epidemic, than with the current Russia-Ukraine situation. She wrote on Twitter:</p><p>“No, not at all. I do want to concentrate on what kind of punishment Boris Johnson will face for ruining my family’s company and the businesses of thousands of others. Many of my acquaintances have lost their companies as a result of government shutdowns. I don’t give a s**t about the war, but I care about the debt caused by two years of no trading.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>It’s said to see so much hatred so I just wanted to say things I really mean <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NuA5WqPcWu</a></p><p>— Kristina Rihanoff (@KRihanoff) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2022</a></p><p>In one of her tweets, she also addressed a Ukrainian journalist who revealed her mother’s departure from the country. On Twitter, she stated:</p><p>“So your mum is walking ten kilometers while you’re in France?” Why don’t you report on everyone who has been mistreated by radical nationalists in Ukraine for the last eight years? Prohibiting families from speaking Russian, terrorizing innocent Russian families, many of whom I know reside in Ukraine.”</p><p>In another tweet, Rihanoff slammed Joe Biden for diverting attention away from Boris Johnson’s “diabolical” parties. She also emphasized her conviction that “conflict is highly lucrative” in the same tweet, tweeting:</p><p>“Thoughts – Biden can only change his own diapers; he can’t do anything else.” People in charge of him are well aware that war is very lucrative. Let us ensure that war occurs. At any cost. And isn’t it wonderful that the UK is no longer enraged by villainous parties? What a convenience.”</p><p>Kristina Rihanoff wrote to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss in response to announcing more sanctions on Russia. Moreover, she turned to Twitter to share the following:</p><p>“No one cares about your penalties.” Like bfr, ALL nations will crawl back, yearning to trade and begin tourism. Stand up for the UK first, sort out your own s**t, and get a geography and history lesson the next time you travel to Russia to discuss politics. You are #embarrassing.”</p><p>She also published a cartoon portraying Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and US Vice President Joe Biden pointing and screaming “Russian guy evil” while standing on top of a pile of dead with blood on their hands. She wrote in the tweet’s caption:</p><p>“I don’t think I need to say anything – pure brilliance.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Dancer</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Kristina Rihanoff</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiiq6GjqbavrYyroKGZnqSzp3nHmptmrJ9irrG7y6ieorKVYry3sdFmn56qXZi8r8DRqK2eqqOerq1507CcnqyjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./feed-your-family-for-20-a-week-lorna-coopers.html><span>←</span><span>Feed your family for 20 a week with Lorna Cooper's fast, filling family food</span></a>
