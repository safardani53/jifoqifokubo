I mean, it's not clinical depression, but we've been a bit depressed about what the experience did. That's an understatement. But we've been through a very hard experience, and our reaction to it has changed us. We are not the same."</p><p>Robyn echoed these sentiments, expressing her struggles with depression, mourning, loss, and grief in the face of the significant changes in the family dynamic.</p><p>Amidst the shadows of emotional turbulence, there is a glimmer of hope in the narrative of Robyn and Kody Brown.
