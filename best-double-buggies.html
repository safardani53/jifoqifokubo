Best double buggy when you've got the space</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-16.02.44.png><ul><li><strong>Bugaboo Donkey2 Duo, </strong><strong>£1360 at Bugaboo - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Bugaboo's pricey pushchairs have a stellar reputation: they're lightweight, easy to push and so, so roomy.</p><p>This single-to-double buggy converts easily to and from a single pushchair with a roomy storage basket and has large, foam-filled wheels to navigate a range of terrains, from city pavements to mountain trails.</p><p>There's plenty of flexibility with the positioning of the seats: organise your children so they're facing you, the world, or each other.</p><p>This double buggy is a firm favourite with parents who rave about how light and easy it is to push, how much storage space it has and how it can fold down with the seats attached.</p><h2>2. Best three-wheeler double buggy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/71zObE51Q-L._SL1500_.jpg><ul><li><strong>Out 'N' About Nipper Double V4, £339.95 at Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This side-by-side double buggy is a favourite with parents because it's well-priced, durable, can handle all terrains and is ultra-lightweight.</p><p>It's also super user-friendly and easy to set up - a huge bonus for exhausted parents.</p><p>The multi-award winning double buggy easily folds down to go in the boot of your car and accommodates children of different ages (the seats recline, and you can also attach either one or two newborn carrycots for twins).</p><p>Not only is it a favourite with parents, who like that it's "UNSTOPPABLE. I can load it into my car in seconds and it snaps up again in seconds," "nice and light, narrow and compact when folded," and a "brilliant double pushchair," it's also the double buggy that childcare professionals opt for. Which says it all, really.</p><h2>3. Best budget double buggy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3220746_R_Z001A.jpg><ul><li><strong>Joie Aire Blue and Pink Twin Pushchair, £139.99 at Argos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>With some double buggies costing over £1k, it's good to know there's a cheap-as-chips version that is easy to push, folds down easily and is beloved by parents: the Joie Aire, which also has comfy leg rests and multiple recline positions.</p><p>Parents absolutely rave about it, and it comes with plenty of extras for the cost, including a shopping basket and rain cover.</p><h2>4. Best side-by-side double buggy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-16.25.24.png><ul><li><strong>Mountain Buggy Duet Pushchair, £549 at The Baby Room - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Mountain Buggy is a pleasure to push, gliding along pavements with a handlebar that's a dream to control.</p><p>It's very easy to manoeuvre along a range of terrains, from city pavements to grassy and forest trails.</p><p>The other big advantage with this double buggy is that despite being a side-by-side configuration, it's as slim as a wide single buggy and fits through most doorways.</p><p>It also has an ample shopping basket underneath. You can buy separate carrycots to use from birth.</p><p>We have to say that we initially used this double buggy with reluctance (having made do with a buggy board and single buggy when our family welcomed a second child) but with a smaller age gap (two years as opposed to two-and-a-half), we felt a double buggy was an essential item and the Mountain made us complete converts.</p><p>It's such a pleasure to push around that going back to a single buggy will be a struggle.</p><h2 class="styles__ColorDetailContainer-sc-1go3748-14 CSHUg">5. Best inline double buggy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-07.17.38.png><ul><li class=prices-container><strong>UPPAbaby Vista Pushchair and Carrycot, £929.99 at John Lewis - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The UPPAbaby Vista really has it all: a stunning design, including genuine leather detailing, it's easy to switch from a single to a double and back again and allows for multiple child-and-baby configurations.</p><p>There's a huge shopping basket and you can transport the whole family (you can even add on a buggy board so you're wheeling three kids around at once).</p><p>Car seat compatible, with a stand-up fold, this double buggy has an added bonus: the newborn carrycot feature has been rigorously tested and is safe enough to be used as a Moses basket for overnight snoozing.</p><p>As one reviewer raves: "This is, by far, the best, stroller I have ever used - and I'm kind of a stroller junkie, so I've tried more than my fair share of them."</p><h2>6. Best newcomer double buggy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/237443570.jpg><ul><li><strong>Nuna Demi Grow Pushchair, £600 at John Lewis - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This Dutch brand is quickly becoming a firm favourite for its ability to handle any terrain, adaptability for growing families (it converts from a single to a double and back again), swanky overall look and all of the amazing extras that are included.</p><p>It all comes down to the little details: plastic wheel fenders to protect your little one, an ultra-spacious shopping basket, a sunshade that zips on and off.</p><p>As one reviewer vouches: "Everything about it is amazing. No hidden costs for adaptors to make it a double or to put the cot higher. It's all included. It's got so many hidden extras to make life easier."</p><h2>7. Best convertible double buggy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-07.56.42.png><ul><li><strong>iCandy Peach Satin Blossom Pushchair, £1,145 at Kiddies Kingdom - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>iCandy's fashion-forward, colourful pushchair designs are renowned for their innovative technology (this iCandy is created using aeronautical engineering), and one of the key USPs of the iCandy Peach Blossom is the ease with which it converts from a single to a double buggy and back again.</p><p>It's all about flexibility, and its spacious seats can be configured in multiple different arrangements to suit your family, whether you have twins or two kids of different ages.</p><p>It's easy to push on a variety of terrains and parents swear it's amazing - just warn that the price is steep.</p><h2>8. Best double buggy for those on the move</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-08.07.02.png><ul><li><strong>Phil & Teds Sport Autostop Tandem Travel System, £765 at Online4Baby - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Phil & Teds Sport is ideal for parents on the move (it can even be used for light jogging) and is known for being easy to push and steer - it manoeuvres beautifully on all terrains and can easily get on public transport (a feat with most double buggies).</p><p>Parents like the auto-stop brake, which engages as soon as they take their hands off the pushchair and ensures that the double buggy won't be rolling away anywhere.</p><p>Easy and compact to fold, this robust design can handle the bumps and scrapes that come along with pushing two young children in a pushchair constantly.</p><p>This value-for-money travel system package also includes a Phil & Teds Alpha car seat.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More from sun selects parenting</h2></p><p>We’re all about helping you find the best products at the best prices, so be sure to check out more of <a href=#>Sun Selects’ recommendations</a>.</p><p>Need some more parenting supplies?
