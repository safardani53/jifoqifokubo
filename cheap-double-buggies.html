Suitable from eighteen months onwards it has room for two children with secure five-point straps and a weather canopy.</p><p>It can be used for running, walking or even biking, it has buggy reflectors and a safety flag for child visibility in traffic.</p><h2>What should I look for in a double buggy?</h2><p>There are a few different features you'll want to consider before buying a double buggy.</p><p>One is manoeuvrability: you'll want a buggy you can push easily with two children in it.</p><p>Another is how far back the seats recline: if they can lie flat back, then the buggy is suitable for use from birth. Otherwise, you'll have to wait until your little one is around six months before they can ride in it.</p><p>Another key issue for parents when it comes to buying a double buggy is storage: how easily it folds down, whether they can manage to fold it one-handed and if it fits in the car boot are three things to consider.</p><p>Some double buggies have individual seat adjustments, so one baby can sleep while the other sits - another factor to think about.</p><p>Accessories also play a role: from footrests to removable hoods to rain covers to shopping baskets, think about what you'll be using the double buggy for and which features are essential for your purposes.</p><h2>What double buggy is best for a newborn and a toddler?</h2><p>When you have a toddler who can only walk so far and a newborn, it makes sense to get a double buggy, particularly for shopping trips where you may need storage space as well.</p><p>There are some great buggies that have five-point harnesses, so are suitable to use from birth, like the <a href=#>Joie Aire pushchair. </a>If your little one sleeps a lot then tandem buggies are perfect as they have flat reclining positions and can be adapted as your family grows. The <a href=#>Jools Geo Set</a> is a fantastic addition that also has a lot of storage space.</p><h2>How to collapse a double buddy</h2><p>Depending on the type of double buggy you have purchased, they normally have a click drop mechanism that will swiftly fold the buggy down in seconds. Sometimes they may have two buttons on either side which will release the buggy to fold down. Always check you don't have excess shopping in the bottom or a forgotten toy as this can halt the collapse on the buggy and it won't shut properly. Many will also have a secure bar to make sure the buggy does not reopen in transit or at home.</p><h2>Do I need a double buggy?</h2><p>A double buggy can be seen as a bit of an investment with all the other extra baby bits needed, but they can also be a lifesaver,&nbsp; particularly if you have two under two. It is rare that a child will walk for long periods of time under three and if you make regular trips to the park, shops or playdates it can be difficult to carry a toddler for long periods of time. If you have a newborn too, or twins, then a double buggy can fit them both in perfectly.</p><p>Many are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">suitable from birth</a>, come with<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> five-point harnesses</a>, have space for <a href=#>shopping underneath</a>, can be used for<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> jogging</a> or are a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tandem design</a> for reclining periods of sleep.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More from sun selects parenting</h2></p><p>We’re all about helping you find the best products at the best prices, so follow the link if you want to check out more of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sun Selects’ recommendations</a>.</p><p>Need some more parenting supplies?
