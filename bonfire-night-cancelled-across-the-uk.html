which has run for more than 40 years - has been cancelled "for the foreseeable future" because organisers can't keep up with the spiralling costs.</p><p>In a statement, a spokesperson for the annual Sparks in the Park event said: "Unfortunately, over the past few years we have faced escalating costs and organisational burdens, the same as so many of us have been feeling.</p><p>"As a purely volunteer-driven event, where all profits raised are donated to local charities and good causes, it is no longer feasible for us to put on an event of this scale."</p><h2>PUTTING THE FIRE OUT</h2><p>Likewise, Leeds City Council announced that constraints on its constituents' budgets were increasing demand for services and support.</p><p>Electricity, gas, and fuel costs have also drastically increased for the council and they expected restarting the bonfires this year would cost well over £200,000.</p><p>Normally the council funds licensed contractors to run free bonfires and fireworks events, including one at Roundhay Park that attracts thousands of people each year.</p><p>Leeds City Councillor Salma Arif said rising costs mean they must cut all spending that is<a href=#> not essential.</a></p><p>She said: "It is obviously very disappointing for residents that bonfire and firework events cannot restart this year.</p><p>"However the council must work hard on cutting all non-essential spend in the current financial climate.</p><p>"We certainly did not take this decision lightly, and we know that this news will come as a real disappointment to many people, and this disappointment is something that we share."</p><p>Seaford's popular bonfire night organisers have also been forced to begin crowdfunding for their free bonfire night because costs have almost doubled over four years.</p><p>The <a href=#>East Sussex </a>event normally brings in 10,000 people each year.</p><p>A <a href=#>Yorkshire </a>village has also cancelled its bonfire night festivities.</p><p>The organisers of the Tockwith Show have prioritised their strapped budget for their annual show instead.</p><p>Leverhulme Park's popular fireworks display in <a href=#>Bolton </a>has similarly put their event on hold after previously taking two years off due to the pandemic.</p><p>Councillors in <a href=#>Dundee </a>have also been forced to re-distribute its £50,000 bonfire night budget to its annual winter events programme.</p><p>However, not every council is scrapping Bonfire Night - celebrations in <a href=#>Lewes</a> are still going ahead.</p><p>Last year saw between 25,000 and 30,000 people visit the massive fireworks event.</p><p>Although the capital of Wales has cancelled their festivities, free attractions in Swansea and Barry Island have not been axed.</p><p>And in London, Wimbledon Park, Alexandra Palace, Morden Park, Chiswick Park, Battersea Park, Beckenham, and Barnes Sports Club are all still due to host their bonfire nights.</p><p><a href=#>Birmingham's </a>biggest bonfire night fireworks are also going ahead, opening at 5.30pm and the display due to begin at 7.45pm.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p><a href=#>West Midlands</a> events are will also commence at Alton Towers, Grange Park in Solihull, Himley Hall and Wolverhampton.</p><p>Bradford City Centre will be holding a free firework display on November 12 while ticketed shows are still scheduled in Sheffield, <a href=#>Doncaster</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/participants-parade-town-lewes-east-537258262.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ31xhJVwampnkqS7p7XRnmSnoZedwW6vwKeanqScmrFurcKrpqyrXam1pnnUpGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alyson-hannigans-husband-all-about-alexis-denisof-5170201.html><span>←</span><span>All About Alexis Denisof Hollywood Life</span></a>
