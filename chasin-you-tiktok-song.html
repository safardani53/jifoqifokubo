So, why did "Chasin' You" become a TikTok song? Let's take a look at how Morgan's track is being used on the platform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Morgan Wallen's "Chasin' You" go viral on TikTok?</h2><p>Morgan is at the top of the country music game right now, but the reason behind "Chasin' You" going viral on TikTok doesn't have to do with clever promotion by the artist himself. Instead, the trend seems to have originated with user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@aniela.official</a>, who created a dance routine to accompany the song.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a>, Aniela can be seen dancing while watching Morgan perform "Chasin' You" live in concert. The clip has already racked up millions of likes and impressions, and it appears as though Aniela's dance has caught on with TikTok as a whole.</p><p>Like many other songs that blow up on the platform, "Chasin' You" was given a sped-up treatment and has since garnered <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 100 million views and counting</a> across all of the videos in which the song was utilized.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The dance is relatively simple: When Morgan sings "Chasin' You," the goal is to imitate a person chasing someone by running in place, followed by a hand gesture indicating drinking during the line "like a shot of whiskey," and concluded with moving both hands in a circle and rotating one's hips to the line "burnin' goin' down."</p><p>Naturally, plenty of others hopped on the trend after Aniela made it popular.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For those who don't know, Morgan released "Chasin' You" back in 2018 as a part of his album "If I Know Me." Written alongside Jamie Moore and Craig Wiseman, "Chasin' You" was a huge success for Morgan when it came out. It was the star's third consecutive number-one hit record on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, number two on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, and top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>.</p><p>Now, TikTok is to thank for all of the new streams that Morgan is receiving on one of his older records. With fans already pining for his upcoming third studio record, "One Thing at a Time," slated to release on March 3, 2023, it seems as though the singer will be spending another year at the pinnacle of country music success.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWiv8inZLKnpWLBqrfTqKJmq5%2BjtA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-business-michael-bachelorette-own.html><span>←</span><span>'Bachelorette' Star Michael A.
