But, over time, the complexion starts to build a barrier of dry skin cells that can get in the way of a deep cleanse and block ultra-nourishing formulas from their fullest potential. This can result in dull skin, clogged pores, and less product absorption — and it's why dermatologists recommend practicing exfoliation regularly in your skincare regimen.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s important to exfoliate to remove build-up that can lead to blackheads, whiteheads, and breakouts,” Dr. Dendy Engelman, MD, FACMS, FAAD, a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at Shafer Clinic in Manhattan, NY tells PEOPLE. “It can also improve brightness and radiance, creating a more youthful-looking appearance.” In addition to its brightening and clarifying effects, Dr. Engelman says regular exfoliation can also help the skin absorb other skincare products such as moisturizers and serums better, allowing you to see improved benefits. “When you have a layer of dead skin cells sitting on the surface, your products won’t be able to penetrate the skin to actually work.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to exfoliating, though, you don’t want to use just any formula. Since scrubs involve removing dead skin cell buildup, reaching for a gentle formula is crucial. “A good quality scrub that isn’t abrasive can help the skin break down dead skin flakes — over time, this can help with the natural skin aging process,” says Dr. Jeannette Graf, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mt Sinai School of Medicine.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a gentle yet effective face scrub that can slough away dead skin cell buildup and reveal brighter and clearer skin, we’ve got you covered. Our PEOPLE Tested team conducted real-world testing on 15 top formulas to find the best non-abrasive scrubs. After 30 days of testing, we narrowed down our top picks to these 6 formulas.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-tula-skincare-so-polished-exfoliating-sugar-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tula Skincare Exfoliating Sugar Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/a7mjCoHnY9vSjIUyggqhpXq4Cps=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tula-skincare-so-polished-exfoliating-sugar-scrub-fc4cdb566f2c48149989b05378be69dc.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Exfoliation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>The formula features both chemical and physical exfoliants that effectively slough away dead skin without causing irritation.&nbsp;</p></li><li readability=0><p>After 30 days of testing, this face scrub helped minimize our pores.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s safe for sensitive skin types.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Tula Skincare So Polished Exfoliating Sugar Scrub is our top pick for the best non-abrasive scrub. Formulated with a blend of probiotic extracts for smoothing the skin and improving texture, pineapple and papaya extracts for breaking down dead skin and brightening the complexion, and sugar for softly polishing, this skin exfoliant boasts both a chemical and physical formula that is designed for all skin types, including sensitive.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After testing several formulas, we found that this sugar scrub works best at lifting away dead skin cell buildup without scratching the skin or causing redness. We love that it combines the manual exfoliation of sugar with the gentle and effective exfoliation of chemical ingredients (pineapple and papaya). It doesn’t just brighten the complexion through exfoliation, it also softens and smooths the skin’s overall texture.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Following the 30-day testing period, we noticed that our skin looked brighter and smoother, and our pores appeared much smaller. A few testers made a point to note that their new naturally glowing skin was so profound that they opted to forego foundation, which isn't their norm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2.9 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Probiotic extracts, papaya enzymes, pineapple enzymes, sugar | <strong>Type: </strong>Physical and chemical</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-neutrogena-deep-clean-gentle-daily-facial-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Daily Facial Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/eT_sy2i3c0-8azFpFsvLaUqmYm8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/neutrogena-deep-clean-gentle-daily-facial-scrub-eda4eccc4a0d47d8b26b14e7053a4ad3.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Exfoliation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>It’s formulated without oil and is non-comedogenic, so it’s a great option for those with oily or acne-prone complexions.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s effective at removing makeup.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This drugstore formula also features beta hydroxy acids to chemically exfoliate the skin.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a more budget-friendly face scrub, we recommend the Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Daily Facial Scrub, which you can find on Amazon for under $10. This face scrub combines physical and chemical exfoliants that gently remove dead skin for a polishing effect that smooths and softens the complexion. Additionally, the non-abrasive face scrub is also formulated without oil, and it is non-comedogenic, so it won’t clog pores therefore making it an excellent option for oily or acne-prone skin types.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since this is a daily face scrub, we tested this formula every day for a month to see how well it performs. Regular exfoliation made our skin look and feel softer and smoother without feeling stripped. In addition to using it as a skin exfoliator, we also incorporated it into our makeup removal process and found that it’s effective at lifting away foundation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we noticed that skin was much softer and less dry after continued use, one tester noted that they didn't see a visible difference in terms of brightness — though for the affordable price, they would still highly recommend this effective yet gentle scrub.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4.2 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Beta hydroxy | <strong>Type: </strong>Physical and chemical</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-softening-pca-skin-pore-refining-treatment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Softening</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PCA Skin Pore Refining Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/a24p2t-7--Wvlw6KqpvFw59X0B4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pca-skin-pore-refining-treatment--1096a5d9ac9b42f5b18358ac90e14bd9.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Exfoliation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>It’s formulated with ultra-gentle physical and chemical exfoliants that soften and smooth the skin.</p></li><li readability=0><p>With regular use, we saw a decrease in excess oil production without a stripped feeling.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The formula helped clear our pores and made them look smaller, too.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If softer skin is your goal, we recommend the PCA Skin Pore Refining Treatment, which is formulated with mandelic acid, rice powder, pumice, papain, kaolin, and bentonite. The exfoliating formula is both physical and chemical and designed to brighten, smooth out uneven texture, absorb excess oil and impurities, and gently exfoliate without irritating.&nbsp;Our tester liked that it has a nice viscous consistency that makes it easy to spread evenly over the skin and that her complexion did not feel tight or raw after using.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the testing period, we saw a difference in the amount of excess oil on our T-zone.

The Dermalogica Daily Milkfoliant is our top pick for this category because the formula features ultra-gentle physical and chemical exfoliants with deeply nourishing ingredients such as coconut milk to remove dry skin, improve texture, and support better absorption of hydrating ingredients. This is a bit of a unique formula in that it's a dry powder that you lather into wet hands, so it may take some getting used to in order to create the right ratio for your preference.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During testing, we found that this formula helped to lift away dry skin buildup and softened our complexion while improving the overall absorption of nourishing serums and moisturizers.&nbsp;One tester even used this formula after an eczema flare-up and said that it was effective at soothing skin irritation thanks to the oat-based ingredients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.45 oz., 2.6 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Oat and coconut powder, grape extract, arginine, coconut milk, papain extract | <strong>Type: </strong>Physical and chemical</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-blackheads-peach--lily-glass-skin-face-polisher></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Blackheads</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Peach & Lily Glass Skin Face Polisher</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/FtOoEuXxo8Noq3HpNcHEkJoEcqs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peach--lily-glass-skin-face-polisher-f5cfa01dd4124a48832facdf533f02fa.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Exfoliation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>The formula features both physical and chemical exfoliants that gently target excess oil.&nbsp;</p></li><li readability=1><p>Despite its grainy, powdery formula, it doesn’t scratch or irritate the skin.</p></li><li readability=0><p>After just one use, we saw a difference in pore visibility.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the best ways to relieve skin of blackheads is to introduce regular exfoliation into your skincare routine.

After just one use, we saw a major difference in our pores’ clarity (read: they were less congested and were less noticeable). One of our testers even called it a "skin vacuum" because of its effectiveness. All in all, we were very impressed with how well this scrub improved the overall clarity of our skin while still being gentle and leaving it feeling soft and nourished after use rather than tight and raw.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2.6 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Allantoin, ginseng, CrystalRice, salicylic acid, fruit extracts, Angelica root | <strong>Type: </strong>Physical and chemical</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-cetaphil-extra-gentle-daily-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Value</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cetaphil Extra Gentle Daily Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Qecvf_sk_htELn5wKRCvqQ3e1jM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cetaphil-extra-gentle-daily-scrub-8150f06528774b7b8047e562faa2d23e.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Distribution</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Exfoliation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>It’s formulated with micro-fine granules that lift away dead skin and help balance excess oil production.&nbsp;</p></li><li readability=0><p>With regular use, we saw improvement of our skin’s texture.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It boasts a hypoallergenic formula that is safe for sensitive skin types.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t love a face scrub but still want to reap the benefits, an exfoliating cleanser is a fantastic alternative.

You can find face scrubs in two types: either solely physical or a combination of physical and chemical. Physical refers to ingredients that physically slough off dead skin buildup, while chemical refers to ingredients that gently dissolve dead skin cells on the skin’s surface. Examples of physical exfoliants include sugar, rice powder, milk powder, and oat powder. You might also see these exfoliants referred to as “micro-fine granules,” too. Chemical exfoliants refer to more acid-based or enzyme ingredients such as salicylic acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, pineapple enzymes, papaya enzymes, and pomegranate enzymes.&nbsp;While many formulas feature just physical exfoliants, you can also find several skincare products with a mix of both, including our top pick for the best non-abrasive scrub, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tula Skincare So Polished Exfoliating Sugar Scrub</a>, and our top pick for the best softening scrub, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">PCA Skin Pore Refining Treatment</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to exfoliants, it’s also worth considering other ingredients that can support additional skincare benefits, such as hydration, pore cleansing, and brightening. “If you have dry skin, look for a scrub formulated with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, aloe, [and] hyaluronic acid, [as well as] salicylic acid or niacinamide,” says Dr. Engelman. Salicylic acid is great for acne prone skin (which can be found in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Peach & Lily Glass Skin Face Polisher</a>). Niacinamide is also a great ingredient for acne as well as a skin strengthener to prevent moisture loss.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fragrance&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You'll also want to take note of fragrance, as Dr. Graf says some face scrubs are highly fragranced with artificial aromas. “I recommend looking for a scrub that is either fragrance-free or lightly fragranced using natural ingredients,” she explains. For a fragrance-free formula, we recommend the<strong> </strong><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cetaphil Exfoliating Face Wash</a>, which is a hypoallergenic exfoliating cleanser and great for sensitive skin types.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the best non-abrasive scrubs, we researched dozens of options, carefully considering the different types of formulas, ingredients, and exfoliant types before narrowing down our top picks. From there, we put 15 formulas through real-world, at-home testing over the course of four weeks. Throughout this time, we considered the frequency of use and application method while also taking extensive notes on how well the formulas performed throughout the trial period. Additionally, we noted whether the scrubs caused any irritation to ensure they were truly non-abrasive and non-irritating.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After the month-long testing period, our PEOPLE Tested team compiled their notes together and thoroughly reviewed each experience to see which face scrubs held up to our expectations.
