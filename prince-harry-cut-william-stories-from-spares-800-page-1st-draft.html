The Invictus Games founder told the British newspaper it was “impossible” to <a href=#>tell his story</a> without mentioning his family “because they play such a crucial part in it” but he made the decision to exclude some details, specifically <a href=#>about his father</a> and <a href=#>brother</a>.</p><p>“But there are some things that have happened, especially between me and my brother, and to some extent between me and my father, that I just don’t want the world to know,” Harry confessed. “Because I don’t think they would ever forgive me.”</p><p>He continued: “Now you could argue that some of the stuff I’ve put in there, well, they will never forgive me anyway. But the way I see it is, I’m willing to forgive you for everything you’ve done, and I wish you’d actually sat down with me, properly, and instead of saying. ‘I’m delusional and paranoid,’ actually sit down and have a proper conversation about this, because what I’d really like is some accountability. And an <a href=#>apology to my wife</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Prince-Harry-Says-Spare-Was-Originally-800-Pages-3.jpg><p>In Spare, Harry details an <a href=#>alleged physical altercation</a> with William in 2019 over the former military pilot’s marriage to the <a href=#>Suits</a> alum​. Harry claimed that William “grabbed” him by the collar and <a href=#>broke his necklace</a> before knocking him “to the floor.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Harry has appeared in several TV interviews ahead of and following Spare’s release. In his 60 Minutes interview, he opened up to <a href=#><strong>Anderson Cooper</strong></a> about <a href=#>where he stands with William</a>.</p><p>“You know, my brother and I love each other. I love him deeply,” he told Cooper. “There has been a lot of pain between the two of us, especially the last six years. None of anything I’ve written, anything that I’ve included is ever intended to hurt my family. But it does give a full picture of the situation as we were growing up, and also squashes this idea that somehow my wife was the one that destroyed the relationship between these two brothers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7FdmMK1edaio6WhkaJ6tMDOq6Ceq12bv7C5jKynmqqVqHp5fI9mp5qflWJ%2BtMCMnamanqRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miranda-rijnsburger.html><span>←</span><span>Miranda Rijnsburger Biography, Wiki, Age, Husband, Net Worth</span></a>
