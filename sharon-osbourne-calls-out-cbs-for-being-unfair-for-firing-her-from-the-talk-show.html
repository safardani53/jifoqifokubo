<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Sharon Osbourne Calls Out CBS For Being Unfair For Firing Her From The Talk Show</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Sharon Osbourne</strong>, a British-American television celebrity, has yet to recover from her firing from CBS’s The Talk program, calling it “unfair.”&nbsp;On Sunday, September 25, she appeared on Fox & Friends Weekends and discussed her departure from the daytime program in March 2021. The 69-year-old was let go after defending Piers Morgan’s outrageous remarks about Meghan Markle. She stated:</p><p>“I’ve been in this field for almost 50 years, 55 to be exact. I didn’t want it to be the end of my career, and it seemed unjust.”</p><p>Sharon Osbourne got into a heated dispute with her co-hosts Sheryl Underwood and Elaine Welteroth on an episode of The Talk on March 10, 2021. Piers Morgan was labeled a racist by the two for his remarks on Meghan Markle.&nbsp;Morgan has previously been chastised for claiming that he didn’t trust anything Markle said during an interview with Oprah Winfrey. During the interview, Markle said that palace insiders would debate her unborn child’s skin tone.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sharon-Osbourne-1.jpg alt="Sharon Osbourne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Sharon Osbourne backed Morgan when her co-hosts called him a racist for his statements. This sparked a heated on-air debate, with Underwood and Welteroth even speculating that Osbourne may have been one as well, considering that she was supporting him.&nbsp;Despite Sharon’s apology on social media, CBS quickly published a statement confirming her departure from the program. It stated:</p><p>“Sharon Osbourne has chosen to step down from The Talk.” The circumstances of the March 10 telecast disturbed everyone involved, including the viewers at home. As part of our evaluation, we determined that Sharon’s conduct toward her co-hosts during the March 10 program did not correspond with our workplace values.”</p><p></p><h2>Sharon Osbourne accuses CBS of treating her unfairly.</h2><p>A clip from Sharon Osbourne’s current docuseries, To Hell & Back, was shown during her visit on the morning program. The documentary dug more into her departure from The Talk, with the TV personality comparing herself to a “lamb who was butchered that morning,” and adding:</p><p>“On the news, CBS denied culpability. That’s because they’re jerks and jerks.”</p><p>She defended Morgan once again, claiming that he had never written or spoken anything racist, and adding:</p><p>“And if you disagree with someone, they may be an extraterrestrial.” Purple, pink, or blue are all possibilities. You don’t have to agree with them if you don’t want to. That’s it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sharon-Osbourne-1.jpg><p>Osbourne lashed out at CBS for labeling her racist, saying she had to live with it since the network “laid the seed.” She said that once a person is labeled a racist, the label “lives with you,” regardless of whether the individual is a racist or not.&nbsp;The video also showed Sharon’s son with rocker Ozzy Osbourne, Jack Osbourne, standing by his mother as she sought to explain herself amid the racist claims. Jack stated:</p><p>“On live television, you may be ganged up on, and when you go to defend yourself against charges, you can be dismissed for creating a hostile work environment. This is the reality we live in right now.”</p><p>Sharon Osbourne was The Talk’s last original talk show co-host. Holly Robinson Peete, Leah Remini, Sara Gilbert, and Julie Chen were the original members of the ensemble.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqoZmipLtuu9Kbpq6qnpp6pK3Lpapmp6WpeqSu0madqKpdl7KqusZmrKeekZ6%2FbrLOq2SfoaKeu6h5x56pZp6ipLpuwMeeZK2ZnKB6tLTOsGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neil-patrick-harris-plays-drinking-game-with-meredith-vieira-video-2014189.html><span>←</span><span>Neil Patrick Harris Plays Drinking Game With Meredith Vieira: Video</span></a>
