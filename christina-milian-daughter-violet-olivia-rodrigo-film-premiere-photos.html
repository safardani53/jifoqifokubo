She topped off the stunning look with a pair of dangling earrings, a single gold bracelet and pink high heels. Her trademark raven tresses were left long and loose with a simple part down the middle. Christina went with minimal makeup, allowing her natural beauty to shine. Violet, meanwhile, stood taller than her mom as she donned a cute pink jacket over a light green romper set. To add to the age-appropriate look, Violet stomped the red carpet in a pair of fresh checkered sneakers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Christina obviously adores Violet, whom she shares with rapper <strong>The Dream</strong>. Last month, the Resort to Love star took to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to pay an emotional tribute to the eldest of her three children on her big day. “Happy Birthday my beautiful girl. Forever you have been my partner, my ace, my best friend. Today you are 12 – I can’t believe it,” Christina wrote alongside sweet snaps of the pair. “This may be the last year you’ll let me kiss you in public (—you’re already acting brand new in front of your friends right now, lol) I hope today is a special day you’ll remember forever. You’re an awesome daughter and a great sister. We ALLLLL LOVE YOU so much.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The mother of three <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed her second child</a>, <strong>Isaiah</strong>, with her French songwriting partner <strong>Matt Pokora</strong> on Jan. 20, 2020. The couple gave birth to son <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kenna</strong>, on April 2021.</a>&nbsp;“Luckily, my partner, my husband is a really great partner in this,” Christina told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY about raising her kids. “For my second and my third I’ve had my husband around to help me, but with my daughter, my mom was there to help me. And then there were times I was on my own, and it’s tough, but you get through it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FuZpygop7AtbXNmmSmoZyerq95w5qsoKCkmr9uwsioo56sXaS5qsLImmSrp5Sntqi7jJ%2BgpaVdpb%2BmucieqZ5loJ28tbvSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carys-princesses-dont-cry-video-interview.html><span>←</span><span>CARYS Princesses Dont Cry Video Is About Being Powerful &amp;amp; Freeing Hollywood Life</span></a>
