That’s not going to fix or help anything,” the actress added. “This has been a tough chunk of history for women. But at one point I just said, ‘I’m not going to wallow in this anymore.’ It’s not my reality—the men I know wouldn’t act like this. So I look to the men I know, who have made my life better, and I just keep remembering that they’re the norm.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0miroZ1doq60t4ycqZ6ZpKS%2FbsPAp6usZZaauqK4xGabq6GmmrtuvsSbpqisXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keke-palmer-joins-julianne-hough-vanessa-hudgens-in-grease-live-2015295.html><span>←</span><span>Keke Palmer Joins Julianne Hough, Vanessa Hudgens in Grease: Live!</span></a>
