He’ll also be keen to protect her and make sure that everything she does is on her own terms, just as my dad — TV’s<a href=#> Richard Madeley</a> of Richard and Judy — did for me.</p><p>I was just 19 when I did my first photoshoot, for FHM magazine. I was so thrilled I’d been asked to do it that when I put it to my parents, I all but begged them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/075725eb-c8b7-4b3d-b99c-20f2a5f1ed33.jpg><h3>'Perfectly happy with showing skin'</h3><p>They found the whole thing wildly entertaining, but I do remember there were some (fairly obvious) ground rules — don’t get sucked into wearing anything you are uncomfortable in, make sure you have full photo approval, take your friends with you and tell them to play devil’s advocate at all times.</p><p>All of these rules were designed to make me feel comfortable, in control, and to think before agreeing to anything. They were to protect me. To be honest, the shoots I do now show far more skin than the FHM shoot I did. But given that I now work in health and fitness, having skin on show is more of a by-product than an end in itself.</p><p>And I’m perfectly happy with showing skin, I make a point of promoting body confidence amongst women. It’s a weird balance, remembering that the sole reason you are in front of a camera is because of your parents, but also presenting the image you choose to present, and not necessarily the image that is expected of you.</p><p>Indeed it’s something of a rite of passage for the children of famous people — like the beautiful women on these pages — to shock a little as they step out on their own. But when a young woman such as Anais chooses to pose confidently in her lingerie, she’s telling the world she’s no longer the child who has grown up in their parents’ shadow — she’s her own woman now. And that’s something worth celebrating.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Daisy Lowe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000358628815.jpg><p>DAISY’S precocious modelling career was already underway when rock singer Gavin Rossdale took a paternity test confirming he was her father when she was 15.</p><p>Following in designer mum Pearl Lowe’s fashionista footsteps, Daisy, 31, has shot for Chanel, Burberry and Vivienne Westwood.</p><p>In 2011 she posed nude for Playboy.</p><p>She has said: “I think the female form is to be celebrated.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000307724883.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Anais Gallagher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000614248359-1.jpg><p>NOEL Gallagher’s 20-year-old daughter by first wife Meg Mathews wore mesh lingerie in her latest shots.</p><p>After they were published, she said: “I haven’t told my dad yet.
