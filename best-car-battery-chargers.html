Phaze 4-in-1 Jump Starter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Phaze-4-in-1-Jump-Starter-e1553181790780.jpg><p>The Phaze 4-in-1 jump starter can be used on any petrol and diesel engines up to two litres and on all types of gel, wet and dry batteries.</p><p>The 17-amp charging power is non-spill and conveniently maintenance free.

Halfords 6-in-1 Jump Starter Power Pack</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Halfords-6-in-1-Jump-Starter-Power-Pack.jpg><p>This jump starter power pack from Halfords is your ultimate go-to power pack, offering great value-for-money.</p><p>It jump starts, inflates and powers all from the one easy-to-store unit, making it great for camping trips. This lightweight power pack features an LED power status indicator, letting you know how much charge is left in the unit too.</p><p>Better suited to cars, rather than vans, the multi-tasking nature of this power pack makes it a must-have for all drivers.</p><p>Keep it in an accessible place, so you can jump start and be on your way within minutes.</p><h2>3. Halfords Automatic Battery Charger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Halfords-Automatic-Battery-Charger.jpg><p>Ideal for small-medium sized cars, the Halfords Automatic Battery Charger suits those who aren’t familiar with these chargers.</p><p>It won’t jump start you, but can put you back on the road in a few hours.</p><p>The unit shows when the charge cycle is complete. It also alerts you if the insulated clamps are connected incorrectly.</p><p>Cleverly, the charger switches to a lower charge rate once it detects the battery is full, protecting it from overcharging.</p><p>Unfortunately, this battery isn’t suitable for vehicles with the Start/Stop feature, so you’ll need to look elsewhere if your car has this fancy eco-friendly tech.</p><h2>4. AA 6V/12V Smart Trickle Car Battery Charger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AA-6V_12V-Smart-Trickle-Car-Battery-Charge.jpg><p>In all the years the AA has served motorists, it's worked out a product range to resolve the biggest car complaints and breakdown problems.</p><p>It’s no surprise then, that this 6A/12V Smart Trick charger has made its way onto that product line-up. With an in-built microprocessor and an LED display that senses the conditions of the battery, it provides the correct current and voltage that suits the needs of your specific car battery.</p><p>Resistant to dust and water, it’s durable and users have reported it to outperform more expensive versions.</p><h2>5.

CTEK CT5 Time To Go</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CTEK-CT5-Start-Stop-Battery-Charger.jpg><p>Multiple award-winner CTEK knows its batteries better than almost anyone else on the market.</p><p>That kind of expertise comes with a hefty price tag so it often out-prices itself from the average consumer.</p><p>That said, performance is second-to-none.</p><p>So if you can afford to splash the cash, the CTEK Time to go CT5 will get you back in the road in no time, taking your battery safely from flat to full overnight.</p><p>It supports with most electronic systems, too, so if your motor has Start/Stop, this Auto Express test winner is your best choice.</p><h2>7.
