Over social media, she shared a photo of herself with a mask on her face and wrote:</p><p>“In the United States, a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer every two minutes.” I became one of them on June 21st.”</p><p>She went on to say that with Breast Cancer Awareness Month approaching, she wanted to share her experience with everyone. The experienced anchor advised women to get their bodies examined and “recognize that you may be one of the people who need more than a mammogram.”&nbsp;She went on to add that she published an article about it on her website and closed by urging everyone to reach out to cancer patients.</p><h2>Katie Couric discusses cancer diagnosis.</h2><p>Katie Couric provided some facts about her cancer diagnosis in an article published on her website. She underwent cancer surgery in July of this year, and her radiation therapy started in September.&nbsp;Couric said that her first husband, Jay Monahan, died of colorectal cancer, and her sister died of pancreatic cancer. She also said that she had a “suspended animation sensation” after receiving the diagnosis.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Katie-Couric-1.jpg alt="Katie Couric" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Katie said that her family had a history of cancer and that there was no way she would be spared. She said that she FaceTimed both of her girls four days after she announced her illness. She added that when she delivered them the news, their expressions froze in amazement and horror before they started weeping.</p><p>While comforting them, she said that she was also trying to persuade herself that she would be alright. Katie continued:</p><p>“They’d already lost one of their parents. The thought of losing another seemed incomprehensible.”</p><p>She also asked that everyone get a mammogram every year. The anchor went on to say that she was six months late and was terrified of what would have occurred if she had waited a little longer. She finished by asking everyone whether they needed any more screening.</p><h2>All About Katie Couric</h2><p>Katie Couric is best recognized as the creator of Katie Couric Media, a multimedia news and production firm.
