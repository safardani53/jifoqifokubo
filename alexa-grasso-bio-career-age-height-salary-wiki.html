Subsequently, she made her debut against <strong>Ashley Cummins</strong> at Invicta FC 8, which she won by unanimous decision.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grasso-140.jpg><p>The 26-year-old stayed with the company for another three fights as Invicta had Alexa contracted for another year.</p><p>She won all of those bouts convincingly in a one-sided affair, which only propelled her status in the MMA scene.</p><p>As a result, the top MMA promotion UFC swooped in and signed Grasso from under the nose of their competitor, Invicta FC. On her debut for UFC, Alexa faced fierce opposition from <strong>Heather Jo Clark</strong>.</p><p>Just like her previous nine bouts, the Mexican beauty won the fight by unanimous decision.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabriel Martinelli Bio: Stats, Transfer Market, Country, Instagram Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>But, in the 26-year-old’s next fight, she was brought back down to Earth as Grasso endured the first loss of her career against <a href=#><strong>Felice Herrig</strong></a>.</p><p>It came as a surprise to many onlookers mainly because the Mexican beauty was the favorite going into the fight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grasso-vs-herrig.jpg><p>As the saying goes, “When it rains, it pours,” in her next fight, Alexa missed the weight limit of 115 lbs by 4 lbs.</p><p>It was enough for UFC to find the talented striker 20% of her total purse for the event. However, she rose through the problematic situation and managed to win the fight via a split decision.</p><p>In her subsequent bout against&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tatiana Suarez</strong></a>, Grasso had the worst fight of her career to date as Suarez won the contest via a rear-naked choke in the first round of the bout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grasso-141.jpg><p>It seemed like the Mexican beauty could not get out of the rot because she withdrew from all of them due to various injuries in her next three fights. What many people don’t know is that MMA fighters live paycheck to paycheck.</p><p>Therefore, pulling out of those three fights impacted not only her health but also her earnings.</p><p>It was the toughest year of the young MMA fighter’s career as she had never experienced something like this before.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Mexican pulled herself together and beat <a href=#><strong>Karolina Kowalkiewicz</strong></a> at UFC 238. It seemed as though Grasso had finally turned a corner, but sadly it didn’t turn out to be true.</p><h3>Alexa Grasso Robbed</h3><p>UFC on ESPN+ 17 will forever be remembered as one of the most controversial moments in UFC history&nbsp;because of the fight between Alexa Grasso and <a href=#><strong>Carla Esparza</strong></a>.</p><p>During the fight, Grasso had put Esparza on an armbar, a maneuver that can snap one’s arm in half.</p><p>It seemed as though Carla had tapped due to extreme pain, but the referee didn’t manage to see the incident. As a result, the fight continued and went the full distance.</p><p>However, there was still one more controversy left as when the fight ended, to the surprise of all the fans, Esparza was declared the winner via a majority decision.</p><p>Anyone watching the match could have sworn that Alexa won the bout as she dominated every round.</p><p>Grasso was rightly angry with the decision as she felt she got robbed. Also, fans all over the world took to social media to voice their displeasure at the result.</p><p>On the contrary, Alexa did manage to win the Fight of the Night award. It was the only positive she could take from the scandalous result. However, there was still another twist left in the story.</p><h3>Why was Alexa Grasso’s fight canceled?</h3><p>The beautiful striker was set to face <strong>Claudia Gadelha</strong>, one of the top strawweight fighters in the UFC at the moment. But, it seems as though Grasso is going through possibly the unluckiest chapter in her professional career.</p><p>To further highlight, the two fighters, as mentioned earlier, were set to meet at UFC 246 in one of the televised fights at the event.</p><p>As it later turned out, UFC 246 was the highest-grossing event of the whole year for UFC. The primary reason is the return of the most eccentric and must-see fighter of this era, <a href=#><strong>Conor McGregor</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grasso-142.jpg><p>However, the fight got canceled because Alexa badly missed the weight limit of 115 pounds by weighing&nbsp;121.5 pounds.&nbsp;On the contrary, Gadelha came in at a perfect 115.5 pounds.</p><p>Consequently, the Nevada State Athletic Commission canceled the fight because fighters must be only 3 lbs apart at the weigh-ins.</p><p>Subsequently, the Mexican fighter announced that she will now be fighting in the UFC’s flyweight division. The reason is the difficulties of weight-cutting and the adverse effects on the health of a fighter.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Damian Lillard Bio: Career, Stats, Contract, Endorsements Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Let’s hope for Alexa’s sake that she regains the form she showed earlier in her career, which landed her in the UFC. And at just 26 years old, I have the utmost confidence that the beautiful Mexican can one day become a champion in the UFC.</p><h3>Career Achievements</h3><p><strong>Ultimate Fighting Championship</strong></p><p>Fight of the Night (vs. <a href=#>Carla Esparza</a>)</p><p>Second most significant strikes thrown in a fight (369 strikes vs. <a href=#>Karolina Kowalkiewicz</a>)</p><p><strong>Invicta Fighting Championships</strong></p><p>Fight of the Night (Two times vs. Mizuki Inoue)</p><p>Performance of the Night (vs. Jodie Esquibel)</p><h2>Alexa Grasso: Age, Height, Weight</h2><p>At the time of writing, Grasso weighs around 115 pounds (52 kg), which is the maximum limit for the UFC’s Strawweight Division. Like most other strawweight fighters, the Lobo gym member stands at 5 feet and 5 inches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grasso-143.jpg><p>On the one hand, Grasso can easily dodge strikes from her opponents due to her reflexes. On the other hand, Alexa can land clean hits on her opposition because of her boxing background.</p><h3>How old is Alexa Grasso?</h3><p>Furthermore, the Mexican beauty is only 26 years old. It is incredibly young for a fighter of her ilk as most top-level MMA fighter only hit their peak during their mid 30’s.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabriel Martinelli Bio: Stats, Transfer Market, Country, Instagram Wiki</a></strong></h4><p>Thus, I believe that Grasso can improve her current ranking of 13 in UFC’s strawweight division and even challenge for the title one day.</p><h2>Alexa Grasso: Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is a massive disparity in the pay for male and female MMA fighters, just like many other professions.</p><p>As a result, the beautiful fighter has a net worth of <strong>$200,000</strong> accrued mainly through MMA activities.</p><p>For her most recent bout at UFC Fight Night: Rodriguez vs. Stephens, Grasso earned <strong>$92,000</strong>, of which <strong>$37,000</strong> was for showing up, <strong>$50,000</strong> for the Fight of the Night bonus, and <strong>$5,000</strong> for fight week incentive pay.</p><h2>Alexa Grasso: Family & Lifestyle</h2><p>Alexa Grasso was born to <strong>Luis Grasso</strong> and had an unknown mother. At the moment, Grasso’s mother’s name remains undisclosed, but I will update it as soon as the information is made public.</p><p>Although Grasso is one of the most popular MMA fighters currently, she is very introverted when it comes to her relationships.</p><p>The beautiful Mexican fighter gets bombarded with questions regarding her relationship. But she has never spoken about the topic publicly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/grasso-144.jpg><p>However, Alexa is rumored to be in a relationship with <strong>Yair Rodriguez</strong>, a fellow Mexican and MMA fighter. It seems as though the pair are a match made in heaven.</p><p>In my opinion, if the rumors are correct, then the two fighters are the perfect match for each other as they understand the sacrifices one needs to make to be a top-level fighter.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Instagram (<a href=#>@alexa_grasso</a>): 427k followers<br>Twitter (<a href=#>@AlexaGrasso</a>): 48.6k followers<br>Facebook (<a href=#>Alexa Grasso</a>): 577k followers</p><h2>Alexa Grasso: FAQs</h2><h3>What is Alexa Grasso’s current ranking on the field?</h3><p>Currently, Alexa Grasso stands as number 12 in the Women’s Flyweight division.</p><h3>What is Alexa Grasso’s reach?</h3><p>Alexa Grasso’s reach is 66 inches (168 cm).
