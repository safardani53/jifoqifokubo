Live it with love."&nbsp;</p><p>The post also saw loads of speculative comments in the comment section&nbsp;about the actors' sexuality. One fan wrote, " All beautiful woman are married, and all most attractive men are gay, Why?"</p><p>But it would be wrong to use any term to define his sexuality as of now.
