But&nbsp;</span>little did he know, the movie would also bring attention to his personal life and spur gay rumors. He got romantically&nbsp;linked with The&nbsp;Hobbit co-star&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Lee Pace</a>&nbsp;(Thranduil).&nbsp;</p><p>If you didn't know, Armitage was previously engaged to an actress in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>So this article aims to give you an in-depth report on Armitage's sexuality, dating history, marital status, and more.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Is Richard Armitage gay? What is his sexuality?</h2><p>While Richard Armitage, who stands at the height of&nbsp; 6ft 2.5 inches, has never commented on the matter of his sexuality, he has publicly led his support to the LGBTIQ+ community. He once Instagrammed a snap of a rainbow flag and wrote in the caption, "Be grateful for love. Be grateful that you can feel it for whomever it is. It's a brief existence. Live it with love."&nbsp;</p><p>The post also saw loads of speculative comments in the comment section&nbsp;about the actors' sexuality. One fan wrote, " All beautiful woman are married, and all most attractive men are gay, Why?"</p><p>But it would be wrong to use any term to define his sexuality as of now. The initial&nbsp;rise of gay rumors related to Armitage can be traced back to 2014 when his relationship status was completely unknown.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During that time,&nbsp;his Hobbit gay co-star Ian McKellan implied in an interview with Brash.de that the two gay actors were portrayed in The Hobbit, according to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Queerty</a>. He made the statement when asked about his sexuality and his thoughts on being a gay actor as compared to previous times.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Armitage, he has not commented regarding McKellan's statement on his sexuality or any other gay rumors related to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Armitage, who led the <a href=# rel="follow noopener">British LGBTIQ+ feature movie Then & Now</a>,&nbsp;also became a subject of gay rumors surrounding his bond with co-actor Lee Pace, as&nbsp;his real-life&nbsp;relationship with Pace became&nbsp;the talk of the town. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The duo was rumored to be an item. Together, they were seen hanging out and attending red carpet events.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Although it is common for co-actors to hang out and attend events together, rumors of <span>Armitage </span>and Pace being a gay couple also got widely circulated. It was the case because Pace was an openly gay actor who publicly said in an interview that he loved his co-actor.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, a&nbsp;particular picture of them fueled the gay rumors.&nbsp;In the picture, <span>Armitage </span>and Pace were seen suspiciously close to one other. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Richard Armitage and his co-actor, Lee Pace, posing at an event.</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">newnownext</a>)</p><p>In addition, the two were spotted in casual meetings.
