Joshua has expressed wanting to collaborate with the “Watermelon Sugar” singer more than once. “What I admire about Harry Styles is that he is a very classy man, and he’s also very well rounded and he kind of does it all — <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>acting, singing, fashion</a>,” Joshua said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/joshua-bassett-harry-styles-hot-interview-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The compliments continued.&nbsp;“I think that he’s just a nice guy who doesn’t say too much but when he talks, it matters,” the Disney+ star admitted. “He’s just cool, he’s cool. Who doesn’t think Harry Styles is cool?&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Also he’s hot</a>, you know. He’s very charming too. Lots of things. I guess this also my coming out video, I guess.” The video then immediately cuts to another question.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fans were all about his love for Harry. One fan joked that his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“drama” with <strong>Olivia Rodrigo</strong></a> and <strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong> “was just to hide his blossoming relationship with Harry Styles.” Another fan wrote in the comments on YouTube, “well we have a second charming harry styles he’s so sweet.” Said one more, “Joshua being a Harry Stan!!” A fan joked on Twitter, “Joshua Bassett having a gay panic about harry and then saying that’s his coming out video it’s a whole mood.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/joshua-bassett-harry-styles-hot-interview-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>We’ll see Joshua playing Ricky soon again on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HSMTMTS</a>, opposite his real-life ex-girlfriend Olivia. Ricky and Nini are still going strong, according to clips from the upcoming second season.
