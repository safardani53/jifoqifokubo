There’s certainly no shame in that, of course.
The desire to want to tweak your appearance is perfectly understandable, especially when your looks are critiqued by millions of viewers each week.
Most of the women on Shore have been perfectly candid about their procedures, but it seems that the same cannot be said of Angelina Pivarnick."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Sooo thankful for u and your friendship."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Now, we try not to speculate too much with regard to exactly what procedures a given celeb has shelled out for.</p><p>Sometimes a different angle or a little contouring can give the false impression that a person has undergone plastic surgery.</p><p>But in the case of Angelina — it’s pretty save to say that she’s had her nose reduced in size by about half.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And it looks as though the procedure took place recently.</p><p>She would have had plenty of time to go under the knife and recover between filming for seasons four and five, and many fans of the show believe that’s exactly what she did with her down time.</p><p>"She was cute before. She looks like a muppet now. Too many exaggerated features," one person wrote in one of the many of the Reddit threads about Angelina’s ever-changing appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"She took the ‘Kim Kardashian of Staten Island’ to heart," another joked.</p><p>"I think Angelina had a nose job. I think her face shape is too different for it to be just injections and fillers," a third chimed in.</p><p>"If you did a side by side of her OG face and her face today, you would see it. Very obvious."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But not all of the responses to Angelina’s new look have been critical.</p><p>"Whatever she did she looks completely amazing compared to when she debuted on the show. Talk about a glow up. Wow!" one enthusiastic redditor wrote.</p><p>Angelina’s nose job — if such a thing occurred — appears to have happened very recently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Pivarnick is generally pretty honest with her fans, so if she went under the knife over the past weeks, she’ll probably talk about it on Shore.</p><p>Of course, unlike the other cast members, whose popularity peaked years ago, Angelina is more famous than she’s ever been these days.</p><p>So it’s possible that with her newfound fame she’ll try to maintain more of a barrier between herself and the public.</p><p>And that means the army of Angelina stans might never get the answers they’re looking for!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WFcK3NoJyloZ6WerG11Zqpp6GToHqosdOsZKykkaK6prCMm7BmnpGjwG64wK2cq2Wgoa60wMicZKytopyys8WMsJ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./golden-bachelor-senior-contestants-unrecognizable-photos-makeover.html><span>←</span><span>The Golden Bachelors senior contestants look unrecognizable in photos taken before major beauty m</span></a>
