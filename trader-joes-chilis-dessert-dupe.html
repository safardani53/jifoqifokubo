They’re my favorite dessert for a special dinner at home.”</p><p>Another Trader Joe’s fan was initially skeptical about the dessert but came around to view it as a favorite.</p><p>“I think most baked desserts you get from the store don't come anywhere close to making them from scratch but these were so close I would happily buy them again if I didn't feel like baking,” the shopper wrote on Reddit.</p><h2>OTHER OPTIONS</h2><p>Chili’s isn’t the only famous restaurant chain with a molten chocolate cake that has stolen customers’ hearts.</p><p>Red Robin also sells its Gooey Chocolate Brownie Cake for $7.99.&nbsp;</p><p>This option comes with hot fudge and strawberry puree and is topped with ice cream.</p><p>A slightly different variant is Cracker Barrel’s Double Chocolate Fudge Coca-Cola Cake, available for $5.49.</p><p>Luxury steakhouses like The Capital Grille sell similar items, like the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake, for $12 each.</p><h2>OTHER DESSERT DUPES</h2><p><a href=#>Aldi</a> has also enticed customers by providing a cheaper version of a legendary dessert.</p><p>The chain launched its <a href=#>Vanilla Layer Frozen Dessert Cake</a> to mass appeal.</p><p>Many say the treat reminds them of the iconic Viennetta cakes from the 1990s.</p><p>The cakes, which contained a smooth vanilla base between frozen chocolate layers, combine creamy and crunchy to make the perfect dessert.</p><p>They were often served for special occasions, but shoppers weren’t able to find them anywhere once they were discontinued.</p><h2>PRODUCT SHAKEUP AT TRADER JOE’S</h2><p>While shoppers have applauded Trader Joe’s for its affordable chocolate lava cake option, the chain still experiences pushback when it discontinues beloved items.</p><p>The popular Banana & Nuts Trek Mix snack was discontinued this spring, leaving many without their favorite treat.</p><p>One shopper shared: “I must be in the minority, but I loved this. I've tried to recreate it myself and could never get it just right! I have one bag left, so back to my kitchen lab I go I guess.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the store confirmed its <a href=#>Peppered Uncured Turkey Bacon</a> would no longer be available in stores either.</p><p>Many meat lovers preferred the seasoned, smoky turkey bacon because it had fewer calories than other options.</p><p>And in what was devastating news for those with peanut allergies, Trader Joe’s also axed its Creamy Salted Cashew Butter.</p><p>The product was a peanut butter alternative that many shoppers praised, claiming it was less oily and more affordable than other brands.</p><p>“I am devastated!!!” one shopper said on Reddit. “My daughter is allergic to peanuts and this is the only nut butter she will eat.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>This is a <a href=#>full list</a> of Trader Joe’s discontinued items.</p><p>Plus, see the <a href=#>top 25 finds</a> at Aldi this week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIVzf5hrbWisopaxpr6Mo6aeq12Ytaq4yKxknZ2jqLKzwIydrKmdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-eastwood-halloween-costume-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly.html><span>←</span><span>The Good, The Bad &amp;amp; The Ugly Tribute Hollywood Life</span></a>
