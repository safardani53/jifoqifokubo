When I get excited, I forget my pants.” She then says they should “put some clothes on you.” “No chance!” he laughs maniacally, as he continues to dance, Ego looking stunned. Another cast member, <strong>Marcello Hernandez</strong>, arrives on stage to be greeted with a huge embrace by the Slumberland star.&nbsp;The promo was for the November 18 episode, which will be hosted by Jason and feature musical guest <strong>Tate McRae</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In a social media post featuring the video, fans couldn’t help but gush over Momoa’s euphoric clip. “Jason never disappoints and surprises every time,” remarked a follower, while another wrote, “Jason spreads such positive energy.
