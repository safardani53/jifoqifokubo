But unfortunately, just before that season started, Greg suffered an injury.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>As a result, he missed that season and watched the matches sitting on the bench. But Greg didn’t lose hope, and he made his grand entry on the court in December of 2006.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Greg-Oden.png><p class=p3><span class=s2>He performed so well, showed exceptional skills, and was even named the once-in-a-decade Player by <a href=#>Steve Kerr.</a> Besides, he finished that game with 14 points, ten rebounds, and five blocks.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Following that, Oden was announced as the Player of the Week.

He was also voted for the conference’s Defensive Player of the Year.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>In one of the NCAA’s prestigious matches named Sweet Sixteen, Oden blocked a potential game-winning shot in the final seconds against Tennessee and preserved an 85–84 victory to lead Ohio State against Memphis and qualify in the 2007 National Championship.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>However, they lost the match against Florida Gaters, but Oden’s game was appreciated by many.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Later, the Associated Press All-American Team named Oden alongside good basketball players like <a href=#>Kevin Durant</a>, Arron Afflalo, Alando Tucker, and <a href=#>Acie Law</a>.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>And the most amazing part was that he had never lost a home game throughout Oden’s college and high school career.</span></p><h3>NBA Career</h3><p class=p1><span class=s1>Oden announced he would be entering the NBA draft 2007, and everyone was excited about his entry. Finally, and not so surprisingly, Oden’s biggest dream of being part of the NBA came true.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>And astoundingly, he was the #1 pick of the TrailBlazer in the draft. So Blazer signed him for two years. But sadly, Oden could not play the first season of the NBA due to his knee surgery.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Even though Oden was drafted in 2007, he was again classified as a rookie for the 2008 season. His injury dragged him a year later as a rookie.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>But he didn’t score any point in the first match as he had to leave the match after thirteen minutes due to injury, again.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>After being out of the game for two weeks, Oden finally scored his first-ever point in NBA in 2009.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Not only did he score his first points, he even scored his career-high of 24 points.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Greg-oden-3.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>However, Oden could not show more of himself with the injuries.
