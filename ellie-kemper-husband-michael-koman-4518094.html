He worked on the late-night talk show between 2001 and 2008, and during that time period while backstage he met Ellie, who was both a staff intern and regular performer for the show. Ellie reflected on their introductions during a 2015 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>, telling the publication, “I was an old intern, and he was a young writer. There was a part of me that was like ‘No time for love! I have to focus on my career!’ ” Ellie said that the two had a conversation about being a couple, which caused them not to speak for two months. But when Michael called into work sick, she decided to reach out. “Let’s be honest. I think he probably had a sore throat,” she told Vanity Fair. “But it prompted me to call.”</p><h2><strong>When Did Ellie & Michael Get Married?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ellie-Kemper-Michael-Koman-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ellie and Michael tied the knot on July 7, 2012 at&nbsp;New York’s Church of the Blessed Sacrament, seven months after they got engaged.

Ahead of the wedding, Ellie told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;that while she thought she was “going to be laid-back about everything,” she ended up being “bossy and commanding” about all thing related to her nuptials. “Especially with Michael, my fiance, I’ve been like, ‘Why don’t you contribute?’ ” she told the publication with a laugh. “So then he contributes an idea and I’m like, ‘That is a terrible idea! Stop contributing!’ ” Ellie jokingly added.</p><h2><strong>Do Ellie & Michael Have Kids?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ellie-Kemper-Michael-Koman-spl-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ellie and Michael are proud parents to two sons: <strong>James Miller Koman</strong>, who was born in July 2016, and <strong>Matthew Koman</strong>, who was born in September 2019.
