Taking place on Saturday, May 6, 2023, the event dubbed “The Fastest Two Minutes In Sports” will see twenty horses race around the 1 ¼ track in the “Run for the Roses.” It’s an event attended by everyone from celebrities to locals to dignitaries of all sorts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>It’s also going to be a wild day. As of Wednesday (May 3), the forecast predicted a high of 71 and a low of 56, with a 60% chance of rain during the day. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Horse Racing Nation</a>, the coldest Kentucky Derby ever was May 4, 1940, at 36 degrees (which was just as cold on the race that ran May 4, 1957.)

The favorites for the race were Epicenter and Zandon, who finished behind Rich Strike. The win was the second-highest upset in Derby history. Only Donerail, who won the 1913 race, had worse odds – 91-1.
