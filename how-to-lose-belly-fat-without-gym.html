Eat small, eat often&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/homemade-picnic-fresh-organic-healthy-867690548.jpg><p>It’s good news if you’re someone who likes to <a href=#>snack</a>.</p><p>“Eating smaller, more frequent meals which are protein-rich and contain complex carbohydrates is key,” says David Wiener, nutrition and training specialist at <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Freeletics</a>.</p><p>David reckons that with the right meals, portion control and timing, you can eat every two or three hours, stay full, and still drop fat around your abdomen.&nbsp;</p><p>“Ideal foods to include in your diet include chicken, turkey, salmon, eggs, sweet potatoes, brown rice and non-starchy vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, and spinach,”&nbsp;he adds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Cut back on the wine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/friends-toasting-glasses-red-wine-867690579.jpg><p>We hate to remind you, but drinking alcohol contributes to fat around the middle.</p><p>David says: “Whilst drinking small amounts of alcohol, in particular red wine, can have some health benefits, drinking too much can in fact harm both your health, and waistline.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Diet & Fitness</h2></p><p>“Recent studies indicate that drinking too much alcohol can encourage fat to be stored as visceral fat (fat that lies within us, around our organs).”</p><p>Aim to drink in moderation, and stick to the recommended government guidelines of 14 units a week.</p><p>A great way to ensure you are adhering to this is by choosing half pints, small cans, or single measures.</p><p>Or, try low-alcohol or no alcohol alternatives which often taste exactly the same, without the huge calorie hit.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Sleep more to eat less</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/young-african-woman-lying-fast-867690593.jpg><p>The worse you sleep, the more hungry you are, studies show.</p><p>“When you don’t get enough sleep, the levels of ghrelin - the hormone that makes you feel hungry - rises and the levels of leptin - the hormone responsible for making you feel full - drops,” explains David.&nbsp;</p><p>The result is <a href=#>eating more the next day.</a></p><p>Work on your <a href=#>‘sleep hygiene’</a> to get more sleep.</p><p>That means having a consistent bedtime, windowing down in the evenings, and avoiding sleep disruptors like alcohol, caffeine and large meals in the evening.</p><p>Aim to get seven to eight hours each night and see if it improves your appetite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Stay hydrated</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mixed-race-woman-drinking-glass-867690600.jpg><p>The benefits of keeping hydrated are endless as water is involved in almost every chemical in the body.&nbsp;</p><p>“Drinking plenty of water can help to detoxify the body, reduce overall liquid calorie intake, suppress appetite, and burn calories,” explains David.&nbsp;</p><p>Aim to drink at least six to eight glasses of fresh water daily.</p><p>If you don’t like the taste, herbal teas are a great and tasty way of ensuring you stay hydrated, or try adding fresh fruit to plain water.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Enjoy carbs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/easy-breakfast-peanut-butter-strawberries-867690626.jpg><p>Personal Trainer <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Duru</a> says that <a href=#>carbs are not the devil</a> and can in fact help with weight loss.</p><p>“It’s making sure you eat the right carbs - that’s the secret,” he says.</p><p>“Pick carbs that contain fibre, such as wholegrains, as fibre will keep your digestive system working properly and they’ll keep you fuller, so you won’t then keep going back for more and more food.”</p><p>Try two oatcakes with spreadable cheese and grapes, or a slice of wholemeal bread with peanut butter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Swap your sugars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/yogurt-granola-berries-bowl-pink-867690632.jpg><p><a href=#>A study</a> recently suggested that the number one contributor to obesity is fructose - a type of sugar.&nbsp;</p><p>“A diet high in sugar can have a particularly harmful effect on your midlife middle, as sugar is converted into glucose and pushed into the blood to be stored in both the liver and midsection,” says David.</p><p>Instead of veering down the snack aisle when you hit the supermarket, stick to the outer edges and avoid artificial sugars such as biscuits, cakes, and sweets.</p><p>“If you are craving a sweet treat, opt for a snack such as sliced bananas with nut butter, or make your own yoghurt by mixing Greek yoghurt with a selection of berries and freezing for a few hours,” adds David.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Make friends with protein</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/row-hard-boiled-eggs-showing-675110657-1.jpg><p>“Eating a diet which is high in protein is an extremely important factor when trying to lose weight, especially belly fat,” says David.</p><p>“A high protein intake will make you feel more satisfied and over a long period of time, can mean that your appetite will decrease.&nbsp;</p><p>“As well as this, eating the correct amount of protein ensures you are retaining muscle mass during your weight loss journey.&nbsp;</p><p>“It can be hard to lose weight without losing muscle, but one way to maintain this is by eating enough protein.”</p><p>Meat comes to mind when talking about protein.</p><p>But you can also get a hit from fish, eggs, dairy, beans and lentils, seeds, cheese, protein shakes and more.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Stop skipping breakfast&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000867690656.jpg><p>Bypassing the first meal of the day might cut the calories, however it’s likely that you’ll make up for this lack of food later in the day.&nbsp;</p><p>“Your body will be hungry and need feeding so you might naturally eat more at lunch than if you’d simply had breakfast,” explains Will.</p><p>“Even a bowl of yoghurt and fruit is a good way to kickstart the day without being too calorific.”</p><p>We’re often told about the weight loss benefits of <a href=#>fasting</a>, but there’s research to suggest it might not be too great for losing weight around our middle.</p><p>A mouse study published in the journal Cell Reports found that the fat around our stomach area may become more resistant to weight loss with alternate day fasting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Don’t always opt for low fat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000867690662.jpg><p>Low fat foods might seem appealing; after all, fat is the most calorific per gram compared with protein and carbs.</p><p>But, Will explains that low fat foods often mean the fat is replaced with sugar, to retain the delicious taste.</p><p>“Low fat yoghurts for example can often be super sugary, which then just leave you craving more sugar and wanting more snacks,” he says.</p><p>“Whereas a full fat Greek yoghurt might contain more fat, but it also has less sugar and will likely keep you fuller.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Don’t save calories for the weekend&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/healthy-dinner-lunch-woman-t-867690683.jpg><p>How often have you starved all week to then just pig out on the weekend?&nbsp;</p><p>Will says that because your body is so depleted in nutrients and food from the week, it will crave so much food across Friday, Saturday and Sunday, that you’ll likely end up in a calorie surplus, and the weight from your middle won’t budge.</p><p>He says: “Although it’s OK to save some calories for the weekend to enjoy a drink or two or a dessert for example, it won’t work long term if you simply binge at the weekend.</p><p>"You’ll binge on sugary, high fat foods that not only contain stacks of calories, but they’re also the types of calories that cling to your middle.”</p><p>Look at your weekend plans early and assess which meals you can focus on being healthy to leave room for some fun elsewhere.</p><p>For example, why not swap the Friday night takeaway for a nutritious salad if you know Saturday you’re going out for dinner and drinks?</p><p>As they say, everything in moderation.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Consider changing old habits</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/woman-standing-scale-close-up-867690706.jpg><p>What might have worked before might not work now because your body has changed with age.</p><p>Will says: “You can’t expect to eat the same amounts and exactly the same foods as you did in your twenties or late teens.&nbsp;</p><p>“Bodies change, and so do our metabolisms, so stop comparing yourself to a past life.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“Plus, as we age, weight does linger more naturally around our middle, so we have to make the adaptations necessary to stop this happening, such as less sugar, more protein and perhaps, smaller portions.”</p><p>Women in the menopause commonly see <a href=#>weight creep on</a> almost out of nowhere, simply because their hormones are changing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZ6g5RsanBnmKTEbsDOZqOoq5Vir6a4y7Jkn5mkYsSqwMeorK1ll666cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karen-finerman.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Karen Finerman net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
