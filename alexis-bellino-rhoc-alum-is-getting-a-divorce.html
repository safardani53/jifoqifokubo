Since then, fans have mostly just kept up with her on social media.</p><p>TMZ reports that <a href=#>Alexis’ husband, Jim Bellino, filed for divorce</a> from her, citing irreconcilable differences.</p><p>He filed the documents on Thursday, so this sounds very fresh.</p><p>He listed the date of separations as “TBD,” so we guess that they’ll figure out when exactly they parted ways. Divorces can be complicated.</p><p>Jim is seeking joint legal custody of their children. He will also be asking for spousal support payments from Alexis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Alexis and Jimgot married on April 16, 2005. As we said, it has been over 13 years since that wedding.</p><p>They have three children — a son, James, and twin daughters, Melania and Mckenna.</p><p>This beautiful family is changing forever. Sometimes, there’s no other option.</p><p>“Irreconcilable differences” is basically divorce court lingo for “we don’t want to be married anymore,” so that doesn’t really give us any insight into what drove these two apart.</p><p>This is Alexis’ second divorce.</p><p>In 2002, she married her college sweetheart.</p><p>In 2004, the year before she married Jim, she and her first husband divorced.</p><p>We can at least speculate a little about when the date of separation may have been.</p><p>Alexis has never been shy about sharing family photos from vacations or home life or holidays.</p><p>But she has not shared a photo that features Jim since April.</p><p>On Mother’s Day, she shared a photo of a beautiful bouquet of flowers — and revealed that it was a gift from her children.</p><p>So … it looks like these two have been on the outs to some degree for a couple of months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It’s worth noting that, during their marriage, the Bellino household was noted for being “traditional.”</p><p>Jim is a self-made entrepreneur.</p><p>Alexis wasn’t just a Housewife — she was also very much a housewife. She managed the household and watched after her children and prepared elaborate meals for her husband when he got home.</p><p>While some of that may have been played up for the cameras, some viewers found the Bellino house’s gender roles to be a little antiquated.</p><p>Alexis was also known for devoting a few hours a day, every day, to fitness.</p><p>She also opened up a few years ago about her personal struggles with bullimia.</p><p>Alexis and Jim made friend with Tamra Judge — back when she was Tamra Barney — and her then-husband, Simon Barney when Simon sold them a luxury car.</p><p>They formed a fast friendship at the time.</p><p>However, though Alexis jumped ship from RHOC before Season 9, she did not enjoy the Season 10 episode in which Tamra got baptised on camera.</p><p>Alexis wrote an email to Andy Cohen, which he shared, saying that she felt that Tamra had “made a mockery” of her faith.</p><p>The two reportedly reconciled later.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how Alexis’ divorce works out. Hopefully, it will be more pleasant for her children than Tamra and Simon’s divorce was for theirs.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Real Housewives All Stars: Who Should Be Cast?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WDcK3Lnq%2Biq12Xsq24yKemZqqYpLBurcuupGaho2K0psDToqWgZZFisarCzquanmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-judge-jeanine-as-shes-dubbed-true-cast-member-of-the-five.html><span>←</span><span> What happened to Judge Jeanine as shes dubbed true cast member of The Five?
