<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Who Is Iain Stirling? Love Island Voiceover Artist: Age &amp;amp; Wiki</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Iain Stirling</strong>, the voiceover artist for Love Island and a BAFTA-winning comedian, is behind the humorous commentary and the memorable phrase “Tonight, on Love Island.” Iain Stirling just revealed to Love Island viewers where he records for the program, and it’s not in the villa’s basic “tin hut.”</p><p>Taking advantage of the Instagram trend of sharing “Day in My Life,” Iain Stirling revealed to his 810k followers how he spends his day, including how he tapes for the program Love Island. Fans anticipated it to take place in a cutting-edge recording studio, but it turned out to be a spare room in his home.</p><h2>Iain Stirling records the Love Island soundtrack in his private studio.</h2><p>On June 7, 2023, the 35-year-old Scottish voiceover artist posted the clip on his Instagram profile with the caption:</p><p>“I’m re-uploading this since the first time it was cut short. That’s insufficient since I can’t emphasize how long this project took me. “A day in the life of a #loveisland voiceover artist.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Iain-Stirling-1.jpg alt="Iain Stirling" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Iain Stirling demonstrated how he begins his day by going to the gym, having lunch with his wife, Laura Whitmore, and then recording the voiceover at his home studio, which he transformed into his “recording studio.” The reel was peppered with clever commentary, as one would expect from the comic. He states:</p><p>“And now comes the piece of resistance.” With one touch of a button, my writing desk slowly transforms into OMG a voice-over recording studio, and I say the one thing you’ve all been waiting for me to say – Tonight on Love Island.”</p><p>The footage surprised Love Island viewers, prompting many to comment:</p><p>“Are you telling me you don’t record these in a tin hut behind the villa?”</p><p>According to the CelebAbility host, he worked in the villa “until lockdown times.” The move is owing to COVID lockdown constraints, but it is also due to his newborn kid, Stevie Re. Iain Stirling and former Love Island anchor Laura Whitmore had their daughter in March 2021.</p><h2>Iain Stirling is a comedian, writer, and TV presenter in addition to being a voice-over artist.</h2><p>He studied law at the University of Edinburgh and found his love of stand-up comedy during his last year of university in 2009. Iain Stirling competed in the Chortle Student Comedian of the Year final at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, finishing second behind Joe Lycett.&nbsp;Stirling’s TV career took off when he joined CBBC, where he hosted series including All Over the Place and The Dog Ate My Homework. In 2017, he received a Children’s BAFTA for his efforts on the latter. Stirling’s voice became associated with Love Island in 2015 when he narrated the program and injected his signature humor into every episode.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Iain-Stirling.jpg alt="Iain Stirling" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Stirling expressed his opinion on Love Island’s continued appeal in an interview with The Scotsman, saying:</p><p>“I think it’s because we’re all obsessed with love and romance.” Every show on television has a love story at its center. “Love Island has removed all of the other elements and is now solely focused on the one that people find fascinating.”</p><p>Aside from Love Island, Stirling has been in a number of other programs, including CelebAbility, Taskmaster, and the ITV comedy Buffering, in which he not only featured but also co-wrote.</p><h2>Iain Stirling Age: How Old Is He?</h2><p>Iain Andrew Stirling was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on January 27, 1988.
