Moments later, <a href=#>his face caught on fire</a>.</p><p>“I said to my friend, I said, ‘Dave [Killackey] I am on fire here,'” Leno recalled during a <a href=#>TODAY</a> Show appearance, via <a href=# aria-label="Deadline (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More from Jay">Read More from Jay</h2><p>“I grabbed him by the head and pulled his head into my chest,” Killackey added.</p><p>“It was horrific," Killackey recalled, "It was a scary thing. It doesn’t take a genius to say, ‘call 911’.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite <a href=#>having a face full of burns</a>, Leno did not go to the hospital until the next day. He then <a href=#>spent nine days at Grossman Burn Center</a> in West Hills <a href=#>undergoing treatments</a>.</p><p>“When he came in, his burns were deeper than I anticipated. Jay is definitely an outlier in terms of how well he’s healed considering the severity of his injuries," Leno's surgeon, Peter Grossman, told <a href=# aria-label="PEOPLE (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEOPLE</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Since then, Leno has been&nbsp;on the road to recovery, but less than two months later it was revealed that he was involved in another incident that left him with a broken collarbone, ribs, and cracked kneecaps.</p><p>The incident occurred on January 17, 2023, while he was driving a <a href=#>vintage motorcycle</a> in&nbsp;<a href=#>Las Vegas</a>, according to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Las Vegas Review-Journal</a>.</p><p>“So I turned down a side street and cut through a parking lot, and unbeknownst to me, some guy had a wire strung across the parking lot but with no flag hanging from it,” Leno told the outlet.</p><p>“So, you know, I didn’t see it until it was too late. It just clothesline me and, boom, knocked me off the bike.</p><p>“You know, after getting burned up, you get that one for free,” he later joked.</p><p>“After that, you’re Harrison Ford, crashing airplanes. You just want to keep your head down.”</p><p>Despite several broken bones, Leno insisted that he was alright.</p><p>“But I’m OK!” he added. “I’m OK, I’m working. I’m working this weekend.”</p><h2>Is Jay Leno married?</h2><p>When Leno is not <a href=#>taking care of his car collection</a>, or spending time in the hospital, he can often be found at home with his wife, <a href=#>Mavis Leno</a>.</p><p>Mavis is known for her career as a philanthropist and currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Feminist Majority Foundation.</p><p>Her work focuses on making women’s rights a non-negotiable element of a&nbsp;<a href=#>post-Taliban Afghanistan</a>, according to her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">biography</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/us-comedian-jay-leno-discharged-777669165.jpg><p>Mavis' work with the foundation has been recognized worldwide and it was even nominated for the&nbsp;<a href=#>Nobel Peace Prize</a>&nbsp;in 2002.</p><p>The pair <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in 1980 and have been living a comfortable life with <a href=#>no children</a>.</p><h2>What is Jay Leno's net worth?</h2><p>Due to Leno's successful career in the <a href=#>entertainment industry</a>, he has been able to <a href=#>amass a fortune over the years</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>As of January 2023, he has an estimated <a href=#>net worth</a> of $450million, with an annual salary of $15million, according to <a href=# aria-label="Celebrity Net Worth (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p>This estimate comes from his <a href=#>Tonight Show</a> earnings as well as several other business ventures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYml9eYSTaK6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxdn666ecuepahlkZiwqrDEp6tmpZ%2BpvLOv2JyjnmWlpbGiwMRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-manson.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Manson</span></a>
