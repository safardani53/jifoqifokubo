He was telling his patients one thing and doing another," a woman (who opted to remain anonymous) told WXIN, a CNN affiliate.</p><p>It all started when a woman researching her biological father found eight siblings after taking a DNA test.&nbsp;</p><p>The woman did more digging and found out that Dr. Cline, who had been her mom’s fertility doctor.</p><p>Dr. Cline pled not guilty to two charges of obstruction of justice.</p><p>Eleanor Nicoll, a spokeswoman for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said that an incident like Dr. Cline’s "happens very rarely," and that the society "doesn’t keep numbers on it."</p><p>Jacoba Ballard is one of Dr. Cline’s children, as is Kristy Killion. &nbsp;Both women wanted to know more about their identity, according to court documents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/fertility-clinic-employee-pic-682x1024.jpg><p>Killion knew that her mom had used a fertility specialist, so she called Dr. Cline’s office.</p><p>Dr Cline said that although he "recognized her parents names," he had shredded his records, so finding the sperm donor would be impossible.</p><p>Killion&nbsp;then put her information on a site that connects sperm donor children. &nbsp;When she and Ballard matched, the two women connected and took a DNA test.</p><p>More half siblings came forward, and there ended up being nine of them in total.</p><p>This was weird, according to Killion, who stated in the documents that "there were only supposed to be three successful pregnancies using the same sperm donor."</p><p>When the donor children found a genetic link to Dr. Cline’s son, Doug, they reached out to him via Facebook.</p><p>"Doug told them his father had admitted donating sperm samples to different laboratories over the years," according to CNN.</p><p>Errrrr, was every single donor child’s reaction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/fertility-clinic-pic-1024x682.jpg><p>Ballard finally got ahold of Dr. Cline, and she, Killion and four other half-siblings sat down for speak with him.</p><p>Dr. Cline admitted to donating sperm about 50 times, "admitted to doing wrong by inseminating the women with his own semen," according to CNN.</p><p>However, he "felt that he was helping women because they really wanted a baby," according to court documents.</p><p>It’s (sort of) easy to see where Dr. Cline is coming from, that doesn’t make it OK to do what he did.</p><p>It should be stated that his donation did not go through a bank.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Dr. Cline also said he "felt pressured into doing what he’d done because he didn’t always have access to fresh sperm."</p><p>Both Ballard and Killion sent letters of complaint to the state’s attorney general’s office in 2014.</p><p>Cline, it appears, lied about his medical practices, because the DNA results clearly stated that he was the biological father of Killion and Ballard.</p><p>Even though patients at a fertility clinic sign a waiver that holds harmless donors and the clinic of any liability, the fact that Dr. Cline breached this could get messy.</p><p>Dr. Cline "breached his overall duty to be honest and upright," which could open up ways for him to be liable for child support, a legal expert told CNN.</p><p>"The current siblings don’t have an obligation to one another — except if there’s an uncontested will, things would get messy."</p><p>Well done, Dr. Cline.</p><p>This is your legacy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><ul
