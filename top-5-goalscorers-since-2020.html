<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Top 5 Goalscorers Since 2020</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>World-class strikers are difficult to come by. Goals win games, and having a player who is a constant attacking threat is a luxury.</p><p>Such players are not cheap, but they raise a team’s ceiling. The world’s best teams have world-class strikers with prolific goal-scoring records. These players are not only outstanding goal scorers but also technically gifted and physically dominant.</p><p>On that note, here are the five players with the most goals since 2020.</p><h2>Number 5: Lionel Messi (Barcelona/PSG) | 67 goals</h2><p>The greatest player to ever play the game has had a rough start to the new season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/messi-1.jpg><p><strong>Lionel Messi</strong> completed a surprise-free transfer to Paris Saint-Germain this summer after his contract with Barcelona expired. Last season, Messi frequently covered up the cracks in a dysfunctional Barcelona team. The Argentina international scored 30 goals in 35 La Liga appearances.</p><p>On the other hand, Messi would have had a much better summer. He captained Argentina to Copa America victory and was duly named the tournament’s Best Player. However, the 34-year-old has yet to make an appearance for his new club. Messi has yet to score in five Ligue 1 games. He is, however, one of the favorites to win this year’s Ballon d’Or.</p><h2>Number 4: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan/Chelsea) 70 goals</h2><p>During his time at Manchester United, <strong>Romelu Lukaku</strong> was used as a scapegoat, with many holding him responsible for the club’s failures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/lukaku.jpg><p>Lukaku joined Inter Milan in 2019 for nearly £67 million, and under Antonio Conte, he quickly established himself as one of the best strikers in the world. The Belgian international is extremely intelligent, physically gifted, and a fantastic finisher. He left Inter Milan with the moniker “King of Milan” and the Serie A title.</p><p>This summer, Chelsea re-signed Lukaku for a club-record fee of £103.5 million, and the striker has performed admirably. He has three Premier League goals in seven Premier League appearances. Lukaku’s form has dipped recently, and he is currently out injured.</p><h2>Number 3: Erling Braut Haaland (Borussia Dortmund) | 82 goals</h2><p><strong>Erling Braut Haaland</strong> is the world’s best young striker. ‘The Terminator has already established himself as a world-class player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Erling-Braut-Haaland.jpg><p>Since joining Borussia Dortmund in 2020, the 21-year-old has amassed an impressive goal-scoring record. Haaland had 27 goals and eight assists in 28 Bundesliga games last season. This season, he has nine goals and four assists in six Bundesliga games.</p><p>Haaland is unlikely to return to Borussia Dortmund for the upcoming season. Some of Europe’s top clubs are showing a lot of interest in the Norway international. Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Barcelona, and Real Madrid are among the clubs interested in signing the young superstar. Many consider Haaland and Mbappe to be the heirs to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo’s thrones.</p><h2>Number 2: Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus / Manchester United) | 83 goals</h2><p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong> isn’t slowing down any time soon. The star forward is still a game-changer for both club and country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cristiano-Ronaldo-1-1.jpg><p>Juventus had a bad season last year, but Ronaldo won the Capocannoniere award with 29 league goals. The Portugal international won the Golden Boot at the Euros this summer. Ronaldo made an emotional return to Manchester United this summer and has already made some significant contributions.</p><p>The 36-year-old has four Premier League goals in seven games. Ronaldo’s impact at Manchester United has been immediate, both on and off the field. He may not be as intimidating on the wings as he once was, but he is still a world-class striker.</p><h2>Number 1: Robert Lewandowski (Bayern München) | 101 goals</h2><p><strong>Robert Lewandowski</strong> appears to have mastered the art of scoring goals, as he almost always finds the back of the net.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Robert-Lewandowski.jpg><p>Bayern Munich signed Lewandowski on a free transfer in 2014, and it was one of the best deals in sports history. The Pole is one of the best players in the world and has a good chance of winning the Ballon d’Or this time around.</p><p>During the 2019-20 season, when Bayern Munich won the continental treble, Lewandowski was the best player in the world. He was supposed to receive the Ballon d’Or award last year, but it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Last season, he scored 41 Bundesliga goals, breaking Gerd Muller’s record of 40 in a single Bundesliga season. He has already scored 12 league goals in ten games this season.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanqou8Clqpynopq%2FtHnSoqWcnV1nfXN8jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rihannas-cousin-tanella-alleyne-dies.html><span>←</span><span>Rihanna's beloved cousin Tanella Alleyne dies aged 28 in latest blow to family after brother shot de</span></a>
