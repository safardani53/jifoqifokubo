It wasn’t easy. I won’t lie. This week was hard, but we got through it.” Keo and <strong>Evanna Lynch</strong>, along with their trio partner <strong>Scarlett Byrne</strong> will be dancing a salsa to Little Mix’s “Black Magic.” Evanna and Scarlett go way back. They starred in Harry Potter movies together and are now BFFs!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“She brings a different energy to Evanna, which I like,” Keo reveals. “She brings more sass to Evanna. I love their friendship. I love their relationship together. They obviously worked together in Harry Potter.” Keo admits that he was worried about Scarlett’s ballroom skills, but “the girl can dance!” Could Keo and Evanna get their first 10 or perfect score this week? Time will tell!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The trio dance isn’t easy, and Keo pinpoints what makes the dance so difficult. “I think the hardest part of the trio is making the trio look good and effective at the same time, while everyone is doing something.” Keo says in our EXCLUSIVE video. “Like, even if I’m doing something with Scarlett, making sure Evanna is doing something has to be effective… It’s all about the picture, man. It has to be solid.” It’s a brutal week for Keo because he has to learn all three steps, but he’s excited to show the world what they’ve been working on.
