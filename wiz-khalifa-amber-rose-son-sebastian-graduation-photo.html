He made sure to tie the look together with Nike sneakers. Not only did Wiz and Amber show up to the event to celebrate Bash, but the 35-year-old’s reported girlfriend <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Aimee Aguilar</strong></a>, was also pictured in the photo. The musician and the TV personality were married from 2013 until they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>officially divorced</a> in 2016. They welcomed their pre-teen son together during their first year of marriage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Soon after Wiz shared the photo with his 36.5 million followers, many of them took to the comments to gush over their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>co-parenting</a> skills. “time really flies <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wiz & amber</a> have always been admirable <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>parents</a>,” one fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>, while a second <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>added</a>, “I love the way y’all coparent so beautiful.” Meanwhile, a third fan couldn’t help but note how fast Sebastian has grown up. “omg he’s grown up so fast!!! congratulations!!”, they quipped. Finally, a fourth fan agreed and noted that they felt “old” due to Sebastian’s age. “Omg I feel so old congrats, Bash!!!”, they <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wiz-Khalifa-Amber-Rose-Reunite-GRaduation-MEGA-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>This is not the first time this year that the exes have reunited, as they most recently attended the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards</a> as a family-of-three on Mar. 4. While on the official <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Orange Carpet</a>, Wiz rocked a black Celine t-shirt with army pants and a diamond chain necklace. Amber, for her part, opted for an all-plaid purple button-up shirt with matching shorts. Bash adorably matched his dad’s designer shirt with a blue Celine hooded sweatshirt and multi-colored sweatpants.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Prior to the event in Mar., the doting mom and dad reunited for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bash’s 10th birthday</a> party on Feb. 21.

Can y’all believe it??? Happy Birthday baby!!! Mama LOVES you so much!!! #sebastiantaylorthomaz,” she captioned the clip with Wiz and their son.
