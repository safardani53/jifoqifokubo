Since then, Kendall has been moving full-steam ahead with Bad Bunny. Here’s what you need to know about their relationship, and her previous public romances..</p><h2>Kendall Jenner & Bad Bunny</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kendall-jenner-bad-bunny-met-gala-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-20>In Feb. 2023, an insider revealed that Kendall and Bad Bunny were seeing each other. “Kendall recently started hanging out with him. They were introduced by friends. He moved to L.A. a few weeks ago and bought a house,” the source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “She likes him and is having fun. He is different from guys that she dated in the past. He is very charming.” In February, the pair were seen exiting a Beverly Hills restaurant after a supposed double date with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Justin</a> </strong>and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Hailey Bieber,</strong></a> per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21 data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>Since then, Kendall and Bad Bunny have been spotted out and about together numerous times — including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>packing on the PDA</a> following a dinner date that included Kendall’s sister <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>. They were also seen<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> leaving an Oscars party</a> together, reportedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>kissing</a> during a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dinner date</a> in Los Angeles, and enjoying a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>horseback riding date</a> at an equestrian center in LA in April. The pair <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got cozy with each other</a> at Coachella in April after Kendall supported Bad Bunny during his set. Kendall and Bad Bunny both attended the Met Gala in New York City on May 1, 2023. but they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>didn’t walk the carpet</a> together. Later that night, they were <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen heading to an afterparty</a> at Zero Bond for more fun.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>In June 2023, Kendall opened up to&nbsp;WSJ about why she’s decided to keep tight-lipped about her relationship with Bad Bunny. She gave a “no comment” when pressed about her love life, and then expanded on her decision not to share more. “I try to find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred,” she admitted. “Also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side. I’ll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that’s the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway.”</p><h2>Devin Booker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kendall-Jenners-Boyfriend-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kendall and Devin sparked romance rumors when they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen outside a rest stop</a> in Sedona, Arizona on April 28, 2020, escaping Los Angeles amid the COVID-19 pandemic. They officially started dating in June 2020, which Kendall confirmed by posting about their one-year anniversary on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> in 2021.. However, she also opened up on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>KUWTK reunion</a>&nbsp;about why she’s chosen to keep her relationship with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her “boyfriend”</a> private despite being in the public eye so much.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I feel like it’s always worked better for me that way,” Kendall admitted in front of her sisters. “And no offense to my older sisters at all, but I think that&nbsp;Kylie [Jenner]&nbsp;and I specifically have had the opportunity to watch my older sisters go through marriages and relationships and breakups and all these things and do them pretty publicly.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She added, “Again, no offense to you guys at all, but I think it was a personal preference from a really young age that I didn’t really want to like… I think it makes my life a lot easier and our relationship a lot better to be completely honest. I just feel like it’s a private matter. It’s not really for anybody else to judge or know.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kendall and Devin were all about having fun during their two-plus years together. In addition to their many road trips and vacations, Kendall was also seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>supporting him</a> at his games with the Phoenix Suns, with fans snapping pics of her in the stands watching her man play ball.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendall-jenner-and-devin-booker-going-strong-backgrid-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>They made some PDA-packed appearances in 2021, spotted walking hand in hand while en route to NYC hotspot Carbone or West Coast celeb favorite Nobu. They also attended several high-profile sporting events, like the U.S. Open men’s tennis championship and the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2022 Super Bowl</a>.&nbsp;Kendall first pulled the plug on the relationship after Devin failed to impress during sister <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kourtney Kardashian’s</strong></a> wedding to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a> in Italy in May 2022. A source EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife,</strong> “Kendall broke up with him because she didn’t think he was taking the relationship <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>as seriously</a> as she was.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>However, Kendall took Devin back in the summer of 2022. After their initial breakup, insiders said Devin was more dedicated than ever. “He’s been laser-focused on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>making her happy</a> ever since,” the source told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY in July 2022. “It’s like they’re back in the honeymoon stage. Her friends and family are thrilled that they’re back together; everyone would love to see them get married.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendall-jenner-and-devin-booker-going-strong-backgrid-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Kendall and Devin broke up, for good, in Oct. 2022. “Both have incredibly busy schedules right now with their careers and they’ve decided to make that a priority,” a source told People. One more added, “They have a lot of love and respect for each other and wish only the best.”</p><h2>Nick Jonas</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Disney Channel star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Jonas&nbsp;</strong></a>was linked to the supermodel back in 2015 when his older brother&nbsp;<strong>Joe Jonas&nbsp;</strong>was dating Kendall’s BFF <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>. It was reported at the time that Gigi set up the pair, however, the <strong>Jonas Brothers</strong> star denied the claims. “We’re not dating. Kendall is great, and naturally, with her being good friends with Gigi and with Joe and Gigi dating, there are times we’ll be in the same place and we all hang out,” Nick told&nbsp;E!&nbsp;at the time.</p><h2>Harry Styles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendall-jenner-and-devin-booker-going-strong-shutterstock-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Kendall’s relationship with “Watermelon Sugar” chart-topper Harry Styles was big news in the early 2010s. The pair were first linked when they were spotted having dinner together in Los Angeles in November 2013, but it was reported that they parted ways a few months later. Things weren’t over for the duo, who spent New Years’ Eve 2014 canoodling on a yacht together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Kendall’s big sis <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Khloe Kardashian</a>&nbsp;</strong>seemingly confirmed the romance. “Do I think they’re dating? Yes,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>. “I don’t know if they’re like boyfriend-girlfriend. Nowadays I don’t know. People are weird with stuff. So, I don’t know their title.” Fans didn’t see much from them until they were spotted shopping together in April 2016, however, they split later that year. It seems the pair ended on good terms, as they appeared on <strong>James Corden</strong>‘s&nbsp;The Late Late Show&nbsp;together in 2019, and even joked about their past romance.</p><h2>Jordan Clarkson & Blake Griffin</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Kendall casually dated NBA player <strong>Jordan Clarkson&nbsp;</strong>in July 2016.
