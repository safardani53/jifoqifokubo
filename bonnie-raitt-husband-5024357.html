Some of her other hit songs include “I Can’t Make You Love Me” and “Love Letter.” The red-haired beauty recently stole the show at the 65th Annual <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy Awards</a> when she took home the award for Song of The Year for her hit “Just Like That.” In addition, Bonnie was recognized for Best American Roots Song for the same track! Although the 73-year-old is a successful musician, some might wonder about her personal life, including who she’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married</a> to. Below is everything to know about Bonnie’s ex-husband, their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>marriage</a>, and more!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bonnie-Raitt-Michael-OKeefe-ss-embed.jpg><h2>Who Is Bonnie Raitt’s Husband?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>The California native is not currently married, but she once had a nearly decade <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>long marriage</a> to actor&nbsp;<strong>Michael O’Keefe</strong>, 67. The 67-year-old has starred in many hit movies throughout his decades-long career including his work on The Slugger’s Wife. Michael has worked alongside some of Hollywood’s most notable names including&nbsp;Meet the Parents&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blythe Danner</strong></a>, the late legend&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Peter Fonda</strong></a>, and&nbsp;Men in Black‘s&nbsp;<strong>Tommy Lee Jones</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Michael is so talented that he was even nominated for a prestigious <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Academy Award</a> in 1981 for his work on The Great Santini.&nbsp;That same year the New York native earned a Golden Globe nomination for his work on the same film. Aside from acting, Michael has also dabbled in directing with one project,&nbsp;Raising the Ashes, to his name, according to his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb page</a>.</p><h2>Their Marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bonnie-Raitt-Michael-OKeefe-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Bonnie and The Great Santini&nbsp;star tied the knot over three decades ago in 1991. Although they stayed married for nearly 10 years, they ultimately <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called it quits</a> by 1999. The songstress and her ex are relatively private people and did not discuss the details of their relationship often. During a rare interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> in 1990, Bonnie opened up about her and Michael’s love story. “This relationship kind of snuck up on me. I was in Los Angeles for a while in the fall, and I made a video about the homeless called ‘Wake Up America’… and Michael sang on the record and was directing us,” she recalled at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“And I gave somebody my number to give to him, and I went back out on the road. He called, and when I got back, we went out and have been hanging out ever since. But it’s not like we’re joined at the hip. He lives in New York, and I live here, so we see each other occasionally,” she continued. Now, 24 years after their divorce, Bonnie has not remarried and is not believed to be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dating</a> anyone. The same cannot be said for Michael who found love once more and married to actress <strong>Emily Donahoe</strong> in 2011.</p><h2>Does The Singer Have Children?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Although Bonnie and her ex were in love many years ago, they did not welcome any <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>children</a> during their relationship. In fact, the “Nick of Time” singer made it clear to&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;in 1990 that she wasn’t the biggest fan of becoming a mother. “In the middle of the Eighties, when I was in my thirties, it was out of the question, because I was so unhealthy and so miserable, and I knew I’d have to clean up before I had kids,” she shared with the outlet. “And now that I cleaned up, I feel like I’m my own kid.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In addition, she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>&nbsp;in 1998 that kids were not a commitment she wanted to make. “Having children is an incredible commitment. That’s why I chose not to. I feel that my job is to mother the causes that I’m involved in. And with me, it’s already so hard to say no,” Bonnie said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GopaehlWK%2ForXTrWShraOXrq%2BwjG5na2xjaoRw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5bwwngxnon2oqw-uzdc8-gvn-xxv5nxe.html><span>←</span><span>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</span></a>
