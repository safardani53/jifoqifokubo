Just sleepy ole me,” Cooper wrote in a May 19 Instagram post alongside a picture of herself in a Belabumbum nursing sports bra and black yoga pants. “While some may say I snapped back rather quickly, my body is still very soft, but I absolutely am loving my postpartum body because it grew and birthed a human being! How cool is that? Muscle memory is also an amazing thing and proof that hard work really does pay off during pregnancy — even when you’re feeling as big as a house.”</p><p>The former nurse and her husband, Grady, 27, welcomed their daughter, Eve, on May 13. They are also parents of son Greyson, 2.</p><p>Cooper — who grabbed headlines in March for having six-pack abs despite being eight months pregnant —&nbsp; worked out five days a week for an hour throughout her pregnancy.</p><p><span>“I gained a total of 30 pounds during my pregnancy,” the 27-year-old tells </span><i>Us Weekly</i><span>. “I have only six pounds remaining until my pre-pregnancy weight.”</span></p><p>But not all of her 132,000 Instagram followers are impressed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Some have called my bouncing back incredibly fast incredibly unrealistic, or they chalk it up to being my genes,” says the Desitin, Florida–based mom. “People love to discredit good old fashioned hard work because they are not willing to do it themselves. Genes can only help you so much.”</p><p>Cooper is used to having to defend herself. In March, the social media star revealed to <i>Us</i> that online trolls accused her of “child abuse” and being irresponsible for her intense workouts. “One person wrote that I am going to give the baby shaken baby syndrome,” Cooper said. “Another wrote, ‘Won’t keeping tight muscles hurt the baby inside?’”</p><p>She continued: “It seems as though it is more widely accepted for a pregnant woman to gain 50 pounds during her pregnancy and stay static than to see a pregnant woman who is still lifting weights at the gym or maintaining her shape.”</p><p>Cooper’s baby girl was born at a healthy 7 pounds, 8 ounces.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGafoaSjsrS%2FjJujqJ%2BXmr9uv8eorqxln5uzbsDOp5ydZZGXwG621KyrZquZrXqlrdisZJqepJq%2FbrPIr6Cnn12XtrPAx2aua2hnaoF2ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rev-run-kids-4529675.html><span>←</span><span>Everything To Know About His 6 Children Hollywood Life</span></a>
