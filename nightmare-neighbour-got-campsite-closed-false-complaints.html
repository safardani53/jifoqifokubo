In 2021 the site was suspended and issued with an improvement notice, requiring significant changes to be implemented.</p><p>"Under new management the site has improved, however the club has not confirmed with the site steward that the improvement notice has been satisfied, therefore the consequences of failure to comply with the improvement notice continue to apply.</p><p>"This month the club was informed by Natural England that a complaint had been lodged with them in regard to the activities, for which Natural England directed the complainant to contact the club directly.</p><p>"On receipt of the complaint and evidence the club again investigated allegation of nuisance behaviour and excessive numbers of caravans sited.
