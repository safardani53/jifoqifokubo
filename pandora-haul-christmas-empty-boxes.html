How?</p><p>“How is it empty? Pandora, I have questions.”</p><p>In another video, the mum films her daughter opening the empty boxes on Christmas morning.&nbsp;</p><p>She captioned the clip: “Empty boxes from Pandora.

This is the third video I’ve seen like this?!” exclaimed one shocked user.&nbsp;</p><p>“This the 4th video about Pandora I have seen today,” claimed a second.&nbsp;</p><p>“Did you not check before you left the store?” asked a third.&nbsp;</p><p>And Phillippa responded: “No. I paid for a service as I’ve bought from them before and never had a problem and I expect people to do their job.”</p><p>And a fourth replied: “Happened me twice in Pandora, once in Germany and once in Ireland.”</p><p>Another suggested Pandora must be ‘off their game’ this year: “I ordered 2 charms and only got one gift box...have heard a few complaints, they seem to be a bit off this year.”</p><p>Other users were desperately sad for the mum and daughter and tried to suggest where the jewellery could be hiding.</p><p>“Lift the foam out in the lid maybe,” suggested one woman.</p><p>“Did you lift the layering inside out? I thought mine was empty till I found it inside the layering,” said another.&nbsp;</p><p>But no, all three of Phillippa’s boxes were empty and it’s worrying shoppers.</p><p>“Omg I’m worried now I’ve just ordered 5 items from the Pandora sale. The boxes better not be empty. I will be videoing me opening it just in case,” replied one anxious user.</p><p>Thankfully, Phillippa and her daughter headed back to their local Pandora shop and the team were happy to replace the missing jewellery.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Pandora has said: "We work extremely hard to make sure our customers get the best shopping experience with us every time, it’s what sets us apart and why millions of people continue to put trust in our brand every day.</p><p>"However, during the exceptionally busy seasonal period – when we make hundreds of thousands of transactions every week – there may be a few rare cases of oversight.
