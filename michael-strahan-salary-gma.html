However, given the documents that have been out there for the world to see based on Michael's divorce from <a href=#>Jean Muggli</a>, we do know some things about his salary.</p><p>In 2019, Jean filed for Enforcement and Modification about child support for their <a href=#>daughters</a>, Sophia and Isabella, and the increase in the cost of living.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The U.S. Sun</a>, court papers said in part, “Michael now makes significantly more income than he did in 2009. Michael is a widely popular (and successful) co-anchor on Good Morning America."</p><p style=text-align:start>The court papers then specified that per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Michael makes $17 million per year from GMA.</p><p style=text-align:start>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sporting News</a> estimates his salary for co-hosting the program is as high as $20 million per year.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by michaelstrahan (@michaelstrahan)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what is Michael Strahan's net worth?</h2><p style=text-align:start>Michael counts a fortune of $65 million at this point in his career, per Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p style=text-align:start>As such, he lives large, especially according to Jean, who alleged that in published reports, her ex has bragged about owning over 16 cars.</p><p style=text-align:start>“Michael owns so many cars, in fact, that he keeps a warehouse in Hackensack, N.J., to hold them all," the court papers she filed in 2019 claimed.</p><p style=text-align:start>The filing went on to claim that the <a href=#>GMA co-host</a> enjoys lavish trips to exotic locales such as the Bahamas and Africa, and travels via private jet — as do his dogs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by michaelstrahan (@michaelstrahan)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael's net worth may also be impacted by having gone through not one, but two divorces.</h2><p style=text-align:left>In addition to Isabella and Sophia, Michael also has two children from his first marriage to Wanda Hutchins. They got married in 1992 and divorced in 1996, but share a daughter, Tanita, and a son, Michael Anthony Strahan, Jr.</p><p style=text-align:left>The exact details of Michael's settlement with Wanda aren't as readily available as those around his divorce from Jean, but we'll assume he lost some of his net worth when they split.</p><p>Meanwhile, it has been reported that Michael paid Jean as much as $15 million when they got divorced in 2006.
