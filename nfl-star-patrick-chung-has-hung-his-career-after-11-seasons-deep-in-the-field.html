Alongside, he has his baby by his side. However, his plan to return to the field reversed.&nbsp;</p><p>As he bid farewell on his Instagram uploads for leaving the industry, he had stated it to be the start of a new journey, with the words added below.</p><p>“I’m in tears writing this, but I’ve decided to hang up the cleats. Bill, Mr. Kraft (mean mug), thank you for allowing me to play for your team for 11 years. I love you to my teammates, trainers, Eq team, video guys, meal room employees, janitors, etc. I love you guys and ladies. Patriot until I die!!! Love you all.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Follow to learn about Drew Brees retirement announcement from the field >></strong></a></p><h2>Patrick Chung and New England Patriots</h2><p>During his 11 seasons career, Patrick spent almost all of his years with the Patriots. Indeed, he was drafted by the Patriots as the 34th overall pick in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Chung was with the Philadelphia Eagles for just a season. Altogether with the team, Chung created himself as a versatile player while averaging a combined 57 in the regular season and playoff games.</p><p>Besides, Chung has bagged Super Bowls in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Overall, Chung maintained 778 total tackles, with 4.5 sacks, 11 interceptions, and two forced fumbles.</p><p>Furthermore, he had five fumble recoveries and one defensive touchdown.</p><h3>Chung’s 2020, a break</h3><p>As explained before, Patrick Chung was out of the 2020 season due to the global pandemic and his newborn baby. Although he stated it was a tough decision to stay, he made it for the family considerations.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Patrick-Chung-with-his-pregnant-girlfriend-819x1024.jpg><p>“I feel money is not that important. I have a girlfriend who is pregnant, a baby girl coming soon, my son has little asthma, my dad is 75 years old. I just felt like this was the best decision for my family to keep everyone safe.”</p><p>With these words, Patrick had added that it was a short break and not the end. However, as now it was the time to be back, he hung up his career over right now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You might be interested in <a href=# rel=noopener>Tyler Shough Bio: NFL, Transfer, Net Worth >></a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4>Corona Return&nbsp;</h4><p>Indeed, the year 2020 is a hard one, barely going by. Unfortunately, The New England Patriots have only a few to be back for 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>During the 2020 season, the Patriots had eight of their players out due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Among them, three are expected to be back only the next year.</p><p>Also, among the remaining, they traded Marcus Cannon to the Houston Texans. Also, from the left out, Donta Hightower seems like he won’t make for the 2021 roster.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides them, running back Brandon Bolden, tight end Matt LaCosse, fullback Danny Vitale and guard Najee Toran are all yet to know for upcoming placements.&nbsp;</p><h2>Patriot’s Loss of an Athlete&nbsp;</h2><p>Patrick Chung had blossomed into his role in the NFL, which depicted a leadership quality as a part of the strong safety. Additionally, he is the same character who led the team to the three Super Bowl wins.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from it, now as Chung is gone, the Patriots have to think of a new defensive role and team as a whole.</p><p>According to the sources, the Patriots have ideas with returning starters&nbsp;Devin McCourty&nbsp;and&nbsp;Adrian Phillips.</p><p>In the meantime, they also seem to be returning top 2020 draft pick Kyle Dugger. However, as the price fallouts aren’t certain thus, they might wait for their next move.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the Patriots have a four-year, $24 million deal with free-agent defensive back&nbsp;Jalen Mills.</p><p>Altogether as Chung had announced his retirement, another NFL folklore hero, <a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Brady</a>, had some words to share with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, Brady just dropped an appreciation post to Chung on Twitter.</p><p>Furthermore, Chung has also stood as<a href=# rel=noopener> Bill Belichick</a>‘s ideal player. At one point, Belichick even said Chung was “one of the best players in the league.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Click to follow more about Tom Brady’s recent contract that will be paving his path to reign >></strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC6xaVkrKyRp3qxrdOroJyjXZi1trrGZp%2Baq12dwq%2BzjKGgrGWTlr%2BmsdFmmJ%2Bslad6cn2MrJyaq5%2BjwG6wxJ6nZqGeYsGpsYyfoJ6klGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./madison-iseman.html><span>←</span><span>Madison Iseman Actress Biography, Wiki, Family, Partner, Net Worth</span></a>
