"Michael Oher discovered this lie to his chagrin and embarrassment in February of 2023, when he learned that the Conservatorship to which he consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member of the Tuohy family, in fact, provided him no familial relationship with the Tuohys."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Interestingly, the 14-page petition shares that a few months after Michael turned 18 in 2004, the couple tricked him into signing a conservatorship agreement that legally allowed them to make business deals using his name. Sadly, the couple never adopted him, as depicted in the film.</p><p>Also, the petition states that the Tuohy’s used their titles as conservators to strike a deal that helped them obtain millions from the film which grossed more than $300 million. Michael never saw a penny from the royalties while the Touhys, including their two children, reaped the benefits.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Michael Oher (@michaeloher)</a></p></figure><p>On the flip side, Sean shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Memphian</a> that he was shocked to learn about Michael’s petition.</p><p>"We’re devastated," Sean told the outlet. "It’s upsetting to think we would make money off any of our children. But we’re going to love Michael at 37 just like we loved him at 16."</p><p>Sean also shared that he found out about the case after a friend sent him the ESPN article.</p><p>"We were never offered money; we never asked for money," Sean said. He also said that “Michael Lewis, the author of the book 'The Blind Side,' gave the family, including Michael, half of his share.” Tuohy told the newspaper that it was around $14,000 each.</p><p>In the Touhy’s 2010 book, In a Heartbeat: Sharing the Power of Cheerful Giving, they said, “We divided it five ways,” in regards to the money earned from the film.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@moc</a></figure><p>Michael’s attorney, J. Gerard Stranch IV, told ESPN that Michael wasn't able to investigate the deal due to the film’s success being linear with his NFL career. He was only able to do so after retirement.</p><p>The goal of Michael’s petition is to end the Tuohy’s conservatorship and obtain a full accounting of the money the Tuohys earned using his name. Michael wants the couple to pay him his fair share of profits along with unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Michael also wants an injunction that bars the Touhys from using his name and likeness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2anmJq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./general-hospital-fans-flood-eden-mccoy-support-replaced-show.html><span>←</span><span>My heart is with you!
