OK Yaar in this tough opener. EKHTIYAAR was only 11th&nbsp;at Newmarket last time but he was beaten less than two lengths and got blocked when coming with a decent run.
That was a decent effort and a repeat of it would put him in the shake-up.
He was an impressive big-field winner this time last year and is only 5lb higher in the weights today.
He has a decent draw and will hopefully break a bit smarter and avoid any traffic problems."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
