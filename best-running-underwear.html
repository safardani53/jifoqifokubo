These fast-drying shorts are soft to the touch and offer breathability during your runs. They also are form-fitting, preventing chafing against the material.</p><p>The fast-drying fabric is especially great for runners, meaning perspiration is drawn away from the skin and quickly evaporates. Translation? Sweat isn't going to build up in your boxers, so bye-bye rubbing and infections.</p><p>Despite their snug fit, you won't feel restricted. These pants are made from 4-way stretch material, so they promise comfort as well as full freedom of movement.</p><p><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester and elastane; <strong>Sizes available: </strong>XS-XXL; <strong>Priced as: </strong>2 pack; <strong>Colour range:</strong> 8 colours</p><h2><strong>Saxx Men's Kinetic Boxers</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/r3_saxon_boxerJPG-JS515292567.jpg><ul><li><strong>Saxx Men's Kinetic Boxers, £24 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>These Men's Kinetic Boxers from Saxx are designed for high-impact, high-intensity sports. So, they can definitely handle anything from a light jog to a full sprint — and they'll definitely see you through marathon training.</p><p>The moisture-wicking stretch material draws sweat away from your skin, helping to control odours and keep you feeling fresh and dry. The flexible material also provides an excellent fit around your glutes, thighs, quads, and hamstrings.</p><p>Yet the draw for most men will be the BallPark Pouch, which delivers contact-free support and keeps everything in place, eliminating chafing and awkward readjusting.</p><p><strong>Material:</strong> Nylon and spandex; <strong>Sizes available: </strong>S-XL; <strong>Priced as: </strong>Single pack; <strong>Colour range:</strong> 3 colours</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2><strong>Niksa Men's Sports Underwear</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/r3_amazon_boxer_2JPG-JS515292568.jpg><ul><li><strong>Niksa 3 Pack Men's Sports Underwear, from £19.59 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>For those who want the discretion of boxers with all the support of running underwear, look no further than these bad boys from Niksa.</p><p>They deliver compression and support, keeping you cool and comfortable while the quick-drying fabric will allow air to circulate freely.</p><p>The main selling point of these pants is their compression aspect, which means they help accelerate blood circulation around the thighs and reduce muscle fatigue and soreness — exactly what you need if you're an avid runner.</p><p>Available in packs for three starting at £17.63, they're excellent value too.</p><p><strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide and elastane; <strong>Sizes available: </strong>S-XXL; <strong>Priced as: </strong>3 pack; <strong>Colour range: </strong>1 colour</p><h2><strong>Manscaped Performance Boxer Briefs</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2021-07-26-at-16.32.36.png><ul><li><strong>Manscaped Performance Boxer Briefs, £20 from Manscaped - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>When you are on a long run or in the middle of an intense HIIT workout,&nbsp;the last thing you want or need is friction.</p><p>Skin-to-skin contact during repetitive movement is a recipe for red, raw and irritated skin. It happens to underarms and nipples too, but the inner thighs and groin are particularly vulnerable areas for runners.</p><p>Chafing can cause no end of discomfort, but these Manscaped boxers are designed to keep high-friction areas cool with a micro-fibre blend design.</p><p>They also look pretty stylish to boot, with a sleek black shape and no-roll logo waistband.</p><p><strong>Material:</strong> Microfiber blend; <strong>Sizes available: </strong>S-XXXL; <strong>Priced as: </strong>Single pack or 3 pack; <strong>Colour range:</strong> 3 colours</p><h2><strong>JustWears Active Boxer Briefs</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Justwears-running-underwear-e1628520419629.jpg><ul><li><strong>Just Wears Active Boxer Briefs, £49.35 for 3-pack from JustWears - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>JustWears has potentially designed the most comfortable pair of underwear on the market, and not just for running.</p><p>They're silky soft, quick-drying, breathable and absorbent - things we love for everyday wear as well as when we're active.</p><p>They've got a pouch to keep your - as JustWears puts it - plums and banana separate, which both increases airflow and provides more support.</p><p>There's also an elongated inseam for a closer fit, meaning they don't ride up and there's no chafing.</p><p>We're warning you though, once you've tried a pair of JustWears (for running or otherwise), you won't want to wear anything else.</p><p><strong>Material:</strong> MicroModal Air fibres; <strong>Sizes available: </strong>S-XXL; <strong>Priced as: </strong>2 pack, 3 pack, 6 pack, or 9 pack; <strong>Colour range:</strong> 8 colour collections</p><h2>Lululemon Always In Motion Brief with Fly</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2023-04-06-at-10.46.02.png><ul><li><strong>Lululemon Always In Motion Brief with Fly, £22 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If the main feature you want from your running underwear is support, go for Lululemon's Always In Motion Brief.
