You go through the daily grind and it’s very challenging."</p><p>"You get to know people in really fun moments and in really challenging moments, and I think that’s what makes the show so successful."</p><p>"I also think that’s why when the cameras stop rolling, I think that’s why many of the relationships you form on the show keep going on long after the season’s over."</p><p>Well, that tells us nothing, except that DWTS is awesome!</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span><p>Dating or not, Chmerkovskiy and the Olympic gold medalist dominated since day one, and the voters noticed; he was rewarded with his first championship.</p><p>"I’m not as beside myself as I thought I would be because I’m incapable of accepting gifts or awards – we just have these dumbfounded looks on our faces," he said.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Dancing With the Stars Finale Results, Performances</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>"It’s more of, we could be brilliant but Charlie [White] didn’t make the final, [<a href=#>James Maslow</a>] didn’t make the final.

"It’s because of them that we have this trophy."</p><p>"Had Amy and Derek’s names been called, all would have been right with the world, everyone would have been amazed at their journey," he continued.</p><p>"She deserved the trophy too. This is why it’s special because those people, the fans dedicated their time to us. God knows we did our best. We did our best."</p><p>"Derek did it five times and that was the first person that I spoke to after Meryl and I won," he said of Hough, his sometime adversary on the program.</p><p>"I was like, ‘Dude, I had no clue,’" <a href=#>he said</a>. "I have to connect with the person and when I connect it’s do or die. When the season’s over, I’m depleted."</p><p>"Right now, I have nothing left.
