Guy not only is a compassionate person, but he's dealt with huge losses of his own — including the death of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sister, Morgan</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Guy Fieri's sister, Morgan?</h2><p>Guy Fieri's sister, Morgan, was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma when she was a child. She initially survived it, but then at age 39, succumbed to the disease. This was in 2011, right around when Guy began his partnership with Carnival cruises and launched Guy's Burger Joint.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Before Morgan died, they launched a foundation called The Guy Fieri Foundation for Inspiration and Imagination, which doesn't seem to be active anymore. Morgan and her partner Annie Antepara had a son named Jules (who is now 20), whom Guy and his wife Lori have taken in since Morgan passed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>By witnessing the kindness his family received when his sister was battling cancer as a child, Guy was inspired to take a similar path after Morgan died.</p><p>"Nothing takes away the pain of being there, but it eclipsed it a little bit, when you get to divert your attention to something else. As a parent, you don't want to think of your child being sick, and those moments when your kid is happy, when he or she's smiling, mean so much," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy shared</a>. Later on, through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, he'd invite the entire family affected by their loved ones with cancer to his show tapings.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>"I know what the family is going through, to some degree. I know that heartache and I see that, and if there's anything I can do to help enlighten or empower those kids, I want to do it," he said. His reasoning for inviting the cancer patient's whole family? He didn't want the child to feel alone or singled out.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He also went to Florida and officiated the marriage of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">101 same-sex couples</a> (during the South Beach Wine & Food Festival), in honor of Morgan. The "101" is in reference to 101 Dalmatians, referring to then-Florida attorney general Pam Bondi as Cruella de Vil due to her anti-gay marriage views.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I stopped making fun of Guy Fieri when I learned he went down to Miami and married 101 gay couples to honor his late sister. It was 101 to "recognize" then-Florida attorney general Pam Bondi as "Cruella de Vil" for her attempts to keep gay marriage illegal.</p>— Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) <a href=#>May 9, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Guy doesn't talk about Morgan often, but he does post a photo in her memory usually once a year on Feb. 19 (the day she died). "Life is short, appreciate every day, and tell your friends and family you love them. Really miss my sister. Namaste Morgan!" he wrote on Instagram in 2016, sharing a photo of what appears to be Morgan and Jules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Miss you my sister Morgan.
