<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Minnie Driver Quits Twitter Over Bikini Body Bullying</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Minnie mad. <strong>Minnie Driver </strong>announced Wednesday, April 9, that she is quitting Twitter temporarily after people posted "mean" comments about her bikini body, which was on display in recent vacation shots of the star.</p><p>"God some people are horrible," the About a Boy star <a href=#>tweeted</a> to her 81,000-plus followers. "You try being photographed when you don't know it's happening, when you're on holiday with your kids." The actress was photographed in Miami with her 5-year-old son Henry, playing in the pool and walking across the beach in a pretty printed bikini.</p><p>At 44, the British star looked stunning in the swimsuit, baring her toned physique and six-pack. Despite her impressive physique, some critics still directed negative, body-bullying comments towards the Oscar nominee.</p><p>"I'm out of this Twittersphere for a while," Driver tweeted in response. "It's too mean sometimes, about your body , about your soul. Not worth it."</p><p>Before Driver experienced the negative side of the social media platform, <a href=#>ABC News</a> published an interview with the actress gushing about Twitter — the same day she announced her hiatus.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I'm mad about it!" she said of Twitter. "It's where I get my news from these days."</p><p>"As a celebrity, it's having a forum where you can answer the nonsensical rubbish that is written about you or not engage with that," she added. "It's given a little bit of control back. I love it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGamoZ6jtqZ5w6ugr52iYr62tdOsZK2vmanBpr6MqK2eql2Xtqy1zaJkm6eUrnqjwculsKKml2J%2FcX2TamhtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-tyson-boxing-st-barts-holiday-christmas.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Tyson spotted relaxing at luxurious Nikki Beach resort on St Barts as heavyweight legend soaks</span></a>
