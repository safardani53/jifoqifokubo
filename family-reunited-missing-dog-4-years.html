Although the family did purchase another dog to keep Bambi company, they told the outlet she ran away about six months later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family performed a thorough search for their dog, but when Babmi didn’t turn up, they assumed she had either died or been taken in by a kind stranger, according to the Associated Press.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Bambi’s owner didn’t initially recognize her when he went to pick her up from the shelter last Saturday, according to <i>The Blade</i>, the dog soon let out a howl he remembered well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She was ready to come home,” he told the outlet, adding that although many years has passed, the dog is settling back into their home “better than expected.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CawbR7xZqkoqSpYr%2Bmwc2iq56cXaK2tL%2FIp55mnJ%2BcenV52J6Yq6tf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fernanda-flores.html><span>←</span><span>Fernanda Flores</span></a>
