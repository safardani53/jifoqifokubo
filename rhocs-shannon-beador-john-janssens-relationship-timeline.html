A month later, Shannon confirmed to Us that the duo met through mutual friends.</p><p>“I’ve never been happier. I’m in a really great place,” she gushed to Us in August 2019. “My friends have known him for 30 years, so I didn’t have to make sure he was there for the right reasons. … He’s just a great person. I have a great connection with him.”</p><p>Shannon was previously married to David for nearly two decades. The exes, who wed in 2000, share daughters Sophie, Stella and Adeline. They <a href=#>announced their separation in October 2017</a>&nbsp;but didn’t file for <a href=#>divorce</a> until that December. It would take nearly two years for the former couple to finalize the paperwork.</p><p>“David is dragging it out and doing whatever he can so he doesn’t have to pay her out,” an insider told Us in 2018, noting that<a href=#> Shannon was “frustrated”</a> and just wanted “this divorce to be over.”</p><p>Us confirmed in April 2019 that Shannon and David’s divorce was finalized.</p><p>“A tough day that ended in celebration and I ran into this friend…” she captioned a photo with costar <a href=#><strong>Gina Kirschenheiter</strong></a> via Instagram after the news broke.</p><p>David, who was ordered to pay Shannon $10,000 per month in combined child and spousal support payments, <a href=#>moved on with<strong> Lesley Cook</strong></a>. The duo announced their engagement in 2020 and wed that October. While the twosome went on to welcome daughter Anna Love in February 2021, they seemingly split in 2022, <a href=#>sharing conflicting messages via social media about filing for divorce.</a></p><p>Shannon and Janssen, meanwhile, <a href=#>were still going strong after more than three years together</a> when he ended things in November 2022.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re two people who love each other very much, but love is not always enough,” he said at the time. “And while I know Shannon sees it as I’ve said things to her I never meant, I hope she’ll be able to see that there’s no bad person here. It’s two really good people who couldn’t make it work. … I think the world of Shannon. I just want the best for her. She deserves that.”</p><p>Scroll through for a timeline of Shannon’s relationship with Janssen:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv6m7wqxkrKCRo7uwuoybnJqcn6d6q7vHp2SjmZ6owKa60mapnqSRqbawutKhoKllpJ66prjIp5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matteo-pessina.html><span>←</span><span>Matteo Pessina- Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity, Career</span></a>
