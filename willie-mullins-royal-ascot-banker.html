Clondaw Warrior, Thomas Hobson and Lagostovegas have also provided him wins.</p><p>Mullins has also won the Queen Alexandra Stakes four times and looks to have a banker horse lurking in it.</p><p>His team in 2023 looks formidable once more and he has runners targeted at some of the feature races, including the Ascot Gold Cup.</p><p><strong>Willie Mullins 2023 Royal Ascot squad</strong></p><p>All eyes will be on his entries in the <strong>Ascot Stakes</strong> and he's got two chances, with the biggest being <strong>Bring On The Night</strong>.</p><p>He faced Coltrane off level weights in last year's running and was beaten less than a length.</p><p>That form hasn't worked out bad, with Coltrane the general favourite for the Gold Cup, and a repeat of last year could make him tough to beat off 3lb higher.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>Mullins also runs <strong>Scaramanga</strong>, who may fail to get into the field given his rating of 89.</p><p>He won a Grade 1 Hurdle in the US when last seen but is just 1-14 on the level, which doesn't bode particularly well in such a competitive race.</p><p>The feature race of the meeting is the <strong>Gold Cup </strong>and Mullins will be hoping <strong>Echoes In Rain </strong>can do the business.</p><p>She landed a Grade 1 over hurdles at Punchestown when last seen and is rated 153 in that sphere.</p><p>Burning Victory was just over a length behind last year's winner and given that Echoes In Rain is rated 10lb higher, she could easily play a hand in a race lacking Kyprios.</p><p>The talking horse of the Mullins' raiding party is Triumph Hurdle winner <strong>Vauban</strong>, who goes in the Copper Horse Stakes.</p><p>He's extremely well treated based on his hurdling rating and he should arrive fresh enough to run to his very best.</p><p>If the full force of his 160 rating rocks up on the Flat, a mark of 101 on the level won't be enough to stop him.</p><p>Not even his also entered stablemate <strong>Absurde</strong>, who was a smart Flat horse in France for previous connections, should be able to lay a glove on him.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Finally, he also runs <strong>Stratum</strong>, who bids for a hat-trick of wins in the Queen Alexandra Stakes.</p><p>Frankie Dettori was on board when he returned with a fair run at Leopardstown in May and the legendary Italian will be desperate to get the leg up again to try and secure another Ascot success.</p><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
