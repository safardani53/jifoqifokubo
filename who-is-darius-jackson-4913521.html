However, the disapproval of her boyfriend <strong>Darius Jackson</strong>, made headlines in July 2023, when he dared to question how she dressed while on a night out in Vegas.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Just over one month following the outfit drama, Keke and her beau have reportedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>broken up</a>! A source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE&nbsp;</a>on Aug. 16 that Darius has “moved on” from the mother of his child. Later, a separate insider told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;that the outfit-shaming drama had a role to play in their split. “Keke and Darius called it quits shortly after he called her out on Twitter for her outfit at the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Usher</strong></a> concert,” they said. “Keke is focusing on her work and her 6-month-old son.” They also claimed that although the now-exes “have been co-parenting” they “aren’t together.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Keke was enjoying a night out with her girls at Usher’s Vegas residency show. A video circulated of the singer serenading Keke while she wore a black bodysuit underneath a sheer polka dot cover-up. When Darius saw the video, he had a less-than-happy reaction. “It’s the outfit tho.. you a mom,” he wrote in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweet,</a> before deleting his account all together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>When he was called out for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shaming her outfit</a> by fans and defenders, he doubled down on his belief, adding, “We live in a generation where a man of the family doesn’t want the wife & mother to his kids to showcase booty cheeks to please others & he gets told how much of a hater he is. This is my family & my representation. I have standards & morals to what I believe. I rest my case.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>If Keke was furious about the statements, she did not let on! In fact, she doubled down herself, sharing a series of photos of herself in the outfit a short while later on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “I wish I had taken more pictures but we were running late,” she&nbsp;captioned a series of snaps&nbsp;from the night. “I am telling y’all right now, if you haven’t seen&nbsp;@usher&nbsp;YOU MUST GO!! HE WAS SO FABULOUS!!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Keke surprised her fans by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announcing</a> she was pregnant during her first hosting gig for<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Saturday Night Live</a> on Dec. 3, 2022. The former child actress later announced the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrival of her first child</a> on Feb. 27, 2023, two days after the baby’s birth. At the time, Keke also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared the first photos</a> of their son, whom they named <strong>Leodis Andrellton Jackson</strong>. Of course, now fans want to know all about the Keke’s boyfriend after the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby’s big reveal</a>. Keep reading to find out more about the actress’ now-ex, Darius Jackson, below!</p><h2>Darius Is A Jack Of All Trades</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Darius Jackson has worked in both the fitness and entertainment industry over the years, according to his LinkedIn page, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> US Weekly</a>. Over 19,000 followers have subscribed to his YouTube channel, per the outlet, where he touted being an instructor at Inspire Fitness.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>On the Inspire Fitness <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>, Darius revealed he played football at Fresno State University on a scholarship. “Since my childhood, I got into fitness from playing sports. I always found myself being active since then,” he said. The site also claimed Darius was “pursuing his career in & received a certificate in broadcasting.”</p><h2>What Was Keke & Darius’ Meet-Cute?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>While both Keke and Darius appear very private about their personal lives, it has been reported that the couple first met at a Memorial Day party hosted by Insecure star <strong>Issa Rae</strong>.</p><h2>Their Instagram Official Drama</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>It wasn’t until the couple went Instagram official in August 2021 that fans found out about the romance. “You’ve been a blessing from above,” Darius wrote of Keke at the time on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “Never would have expected summer&nbsp;2021 to turn out the way it did, but here we are. I’m glad we were able to help each other throughout our lowest of times & show one another that what we are bringing to the table is everything that we got.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>In March 2022, however, fans noticed Keke and Darius deleted all photos of each other off of their Instagram pages. They also unfollowed each other, which has caused breakup rumors to fly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/keke-palmer-pregnant-nbc-embed.jpg><h2>His Brother Was On ‘Insecure’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>The happy accident of bumping into each other at the Memorial Day party may all be thanks to Darius’ brother, actor <strong>Sarunas Jackson</strong>. Sarunas played Dro on Insecure alongside Issa Rae and was reportedly invited to the bbq by her, with Darius tagging along, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Metro</a>.</p><h2>Keke Was Her ‘Happiest’ With Darius</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Keke was all about her romance when she spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bustle </a>in March 2022. “This is the happiest I’ve ever felt with someone,” she gushed. “So why would I go out of my way to hide this person? That’s a lot more work than just living in my life and being in my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kxor7IrqpmopGYuLS7zWZrcmljan9yew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tori-kelly-hospitalized-being-treated-for-blood-clots.html><span>←</span><span>Tori Kelly Hospitalized, Being Treated for Blood Clots</span></a>
