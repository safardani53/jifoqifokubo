There was a 1978 film of the same name, as well as the 2004 episode Poirot Death on the Nile from Agatha Christie’s Poirot. Despite the fact that the film is set on a luxurious boat in Egypt, principal photography for the new film began in 2019 and was largely shot in the United Kingdom. Longcross Studios in Surrey, where the Old Cataract Hotel and the Abu Simbel temples were built for the project, hosted the filming.</p><p>Some scenes were shot outside the studio at Cotswold Water Park, a nature reserve near Swindon, England. In Morocco and Egypt, a second production team shot scenes.</p><h2>Explaining Armie Hammer’s Role In The Movie</h2><p>Armie Hammer plays Simon Doyle, the man who marries Gal Gadot’s character, Linnet Ridgeway. The actor was cast for the role in 2018 and shot his scenes in late 2019, just before the covid-19 pandemic hit. The Los Angeles Police Department launched an investigation into allegations made against Hammer, which were first reported by Digital Spy in early 2021.</p><p>“With the truth on his side, Mr. Hammer welcomes the opportunity to set the record straight,” Hammer’s attorney said in a statement about the allegations. “From the beginning, Mr. Hammer has maintained that all of his interactions with [the alleged victim] – and, for that matter, all of his other sexual partners – have been completely consensual.” Nonetheless, The Hollywood Reporter reports that Disney considered reshooting scenes or replacing Hammer. However, the outlet reports that due to the covid situation and the working schedules of the other cast members, this was not an option.</p><p>According to a March 2021 Variety report, sources close to the project also stated that Hammer’s role was too “significant” because he was the “film’s male lead.” At the time, Disney declined to comment on the matter.</p><h2>What Has Happened To Armie Hammer?</h2><p>According to Digital Spy, While the allegations swirled, Armie Hammer dropped out of several projects, including The Offer, the thriller Billion Dollar Spy, and Shotgun Wedding, a romantic comedy he co-wrote with Jennifer Lopez.</p><p>The Sun reported this week that Hammer was spotted out and about in Beverly Hills. According to the newspaper, Hammer recently completed a nine-month rehabilitation program.</p><p>“Armie is out of the treatment facility where he spent nearly nine months,” a source told the outlet. He’s doing fantastically well, which is fantastic news for his family. He’s returned to the Cayman Islands.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Armie Hammer</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Death On The Nile</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuobFdnsBurdGmoJ5lmJa6rrHRZqCnZZSarrW0jKilZqyYmnqvtcueZJqmlGLEqbHNZq6aq12ewW6yyKWknpxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wes-andersons-wife-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Wes Anderson Dating Wes Anderson's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
