However, he was dealt an unexpected blow on July 11 when photos from the scene of the Soundgarden frontman’s hotel suicide were released by the police.&nbsp;“<span class=il>Brad</span>&nbsp;saw the bloody&nbsp;<span class=il>pics</span>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<span class=il>Chris’</span>&nbsp;room after&nbsp;<span class=il>his</span>&nbsp;<span class=il>suicide</span>&nbsp;and it was really painful,” an insider told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY. “He’s still so, so sad about&nbsp;<span class=il>his</span>&nbsp;friend’s death.” Poor thing! However, his main concern isn’t for himself, but for Chris’ family. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Click here to see pics of the rocker.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“He’s also very concerned about&nbsp;<span class=il>Chris’</span>&nbsp;3&nbsp;<span class=il>kids,” says the source. Chris left behind three beautiful children: <strong>Toni Cornell</strong>, 12, <strong>Lillian Cornell</strong>, 17, and <strong>Christopher Cornell</strong>, 11. “</span>It breaks&nbsp;<span class=il>his</span>&nbsp;heart that they have to see those&nbsp;<span class=il>pics</span>.” Brad is going to make sure that the three of them, and their mother<strong> Vicky Karayiannis</strong>, are taken care of.<strong>&nbsp;“</strong>He’s such a good friend and always reaches out to those&nbsp;<span class=il>kids</span>&nbsp;to let them know he’s there for them if they need anything at all.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>It’s still unbelievable to think that Chris is gone, and the photos released by the police department were particularly grisly. They showed the exercise band the rocker used to hang himself in the bathroom, as well as blood on the floor and personal items around the room like his guitar. That must have hit home for Brad, and we can’t even imagine how hard they would be for his kids to see. Hopefully they won’t have to.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think those photos should have been released?
