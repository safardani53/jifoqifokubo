But I’ll get little things done.”</p><p>In 2021, she told the Ladies of Liverpool podcast her secret to looking young is "Botox", adding: "It’s not so much of a secret, is it? Everyone does it. Name me a person over the age of 50 on the telly that doesn’t do it?”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in I’m A Celebrity</h2></p><p>She added: “It’s quite funny you know, because when you talk about it to people in the industry they go, ‘Yeah, and then it’s like, and?’</p><p>"That’s one of the great gifts of life, isn’t it, just being enthusiastic - whatever it is that you’re doing, be enthusiastic about it."</p><h2>Phil Tufnell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/newspress-collage-22151895-1682431442115.jpg><p>Phil Tufnell was on <a href=#>I’m A Celeb</a> all the way back in 2003, and ended up being crowned King of the Jungle.</p><p>And, ahead of his return to TV, the 56-year-old underwent a £4,000 hair transplant at DHI Global clinic in London’s Harley Street.</p><p>“It has been thinning and receding for quite a while,” he said of his hair. “And I have thin hair anyway. I want to get something done about it before it’s too late.”&nbsp;</p><p>The ex-cricketer had a “lunch-hour” transplant, which meant he didn’t need to undergo surgery or shave his remaining hair.</p><p>Phil - who had his first hair transplant nearly 10 years ago - said he decided to go through with the procedure again after spotting his hair was thinning out in overhead mirrors in a lift at the BBC London studios.</p><p>He said: "I've got a big summer coming with the Ashes and you're on telly and in front of the camera and I suppose there was a bit of a lack of confidence but you just want a nice head of hair.”</p><h2>Helen Flanagan&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/newspress-collage-22151895-1682431263435.jpg><p>Former <a href=#>Coronation Street</a> star Helen Flanagan was famously rubbish at Bushtucker Trials during her first stint on I’m A Celeb in 2012, uttering “I’m a celebrity, get me out of here” almost every time she was confronted with bugs.</p><p>But she’s back again to face her fears.</p><p>Helen, 32, has been open about having Botox and "a bit of filler in my top lip".</p><p>She revealed she'd had a boob job earlier this year after they were "ruined" by breastfeeding, but told <a aria-label="OK! (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">OK!</a> she was "gutted" she couldn't have them done before going on the show.</p><p>The mum-of-three added she “doesn’t know why women keep it a secret".</p><h2>Shaun Ryder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/newspress-collage-22151895-1682431505414.jpg><p>Happy Mondays star <a href=#>Shaun Ryder</a>, 60, first went into the I’m A Celeb jungle in 2010, finishing as a runner-up.</p><p>But in the time since then, he’s changed quite dramatically due to suffering from <a href=#>alopecia</a>.</p><p>In 2019, after all <a href=#>his hair fell out</a>, he appeared on the Chris Moyles Show, explaining: “I've got no eyelashes, no eyebrows, no pubic hair, no leg hair, no armpit hair, everything gone.</p><p>"At first they thought it's going to be the testosterone or it's going to be the thyroid. Well it isn't, because in the thyroid it comes out in clumps, right. Now mine's an alopecia thing and it's just gone. And another thing is, it's not stress related."</p><p>Last year, he revealed he’d had “skin pigmentation” eyebrows - which involves microblading - while talking to his bandmate <a href=#>Bez</a> on <a href=#>Celebrity Gogglebox</a>.</p><p>Wiggling his new eyebrows, he said: "So what do you think, have you noticed? I'm totally fake now. I've got my skin pigmentation eyebrows."</p><p>Shaun has also admitted to having Botox in the past, telling the Chris Moyles' Show: “I went to the dentist, and he started talking about Botox. I said, ‘Give me some Botox!’&nbsp;</p><p>“The guy gave me some Botox while I was in the chair!"</p><h2>Janice Dickinson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/newspress-collage-22151895-1682431645642.jpg><p>Supermodel <a href=#>Janice Dickinson</a> has never kept the amount of plastic surgery she’s had a secret, having spent thousands on it even when she was in the jungle in 2007.</p><p>But the 68-year-old - who once said she was addicted to going under the knife - now looks even more different.</p><p>Since her first stint in the jungle, Janice has had multiple facelifts, boob jobs, a tummy tuck, neck lift, liposuction and Botox.</p><p>In 2013 she declared herself bankrupt after over $1million in taxes and unpaid cosmetic bills.</p><p>Two years later she appeared on Botched to fix her boob job that was done 30 years before, saying at the time: "I am no stranger to plastic surgery."</p><p>That same year she vowed to not go under the knife again, after her son Nathan urged her not to. She said: "I won't do any more plastic surgery if he's looking."</p><h2>Jordan Banjo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/newspress-collage-22151895-1682434769620.jpg><p>Jordan - who was on I’m A Celeb in 2016 - doesn't look much different to when he was last in the jungle, but there is one noticeable change - his teeth.</p><p>The dancer, 30, treated himself to a new set of&nbsp;pearly white veneers&nbsp;from Kiss Dental in May 2019.</p><p>On leaving the clinic he wrote on Instagram: "So happy when I left @kissdental_dentist that I dropped a selfie in the back of the cab.</p><p>"On serious note so buzzing with my new teeth, @drkissdental you are an actual legend, whole team at your place are lovely! You guys smashed these [sic]."</p><h2>Gillian McKeith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/newspress-collage-22151895-1682431995087.jpg><p><a href=#>Gillian McKeith</a> famously fainted during her 2010 stint before a Bushtucker trial, meaning she couldn’t take part.</p><p>And viewers of last night’s show were shocked when she rocked up sporting hair braids similar to <a href=#>Katie Price</a>’s iconic I’m A Celebrity look.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Explaining why she opted for the hairstyle, she told <a aria-label="MailOnline (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">MailOnline</a>: “I was bitten by a tick back in 2010. I have quite thick hair and it burrowed under my hair at the neck, so I thought, I'm not doing that again.&nbsp;</p><p>“The tick bite was very painful. It stuck its pincer into my neck under the hair. It was like being sliced with a razor sharp knife... I didn't want to risk being attacked by a tick again, so I thought I'm going to put my hair in plaits.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpiZoJyhJhuZqKlXZZ6pLHLnpmroaSuerW%2BwKeqn6eioq61tc6nqmarpae0pr7YaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caleb-williams-pic.html><span>←</span><span>Caleb Williams Pic - The Hollywood Gossip</span></a>
