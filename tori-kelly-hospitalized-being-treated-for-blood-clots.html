The setlist includes songs called “Alive if I Die,” “Cut” and “Shelter” as well as four more new tunes.</p><p>Ahead of her trip to the hospital on Sunday, Kelly gave fans a behind-the-scenes peek at her photo shoot for the EP.</p><p>“1 week out ♡,” she <a href=#>wrote via Instagram</a> on Friday, July 21, alongside several photos from set. In one video, Kelly threw up a peace sign as she posed in her dressing room.</p><p>Tori is Kelly’s fourth EP. She released her first extended play, Handmade Songs, in May 2012. Kelly has since dropped two more EPs: Foreword and Solitude in October 2013 and August 2020, respectively.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kelly has also produced four full-length studio albums throughout her career. Her debut record, Unbreakable Smile, was released in June 2015 and reached the No. 2 spot on the U.S. charts. She later dropped Hiding Place in September 2018, Inspired by True Events in August 2019 and <a href=#>A Tori Kelly Christmas</a> in October 2020.</p><p>“Music is kind of all I know, so I’ve been craving for fans to hear that,” Kelly told <a href=#>Elite Daily</a> in May while promoting her upcoming EP. “We were inspired by hip-hop — late ‘90s, to be specific — and R&B is definitely a big inspiration of mine. I’m touching on all these different musical aspects of my career, but at the same time, it’s a new musical era for me and there’s so much more to discover.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp6Keeqyxy6WwZqCfqL2qwMCloLOdlGKvprXNoGStqpWWwaawjJ%2Bmq2WSobywsIyco6iso2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./columbia-ice-maiden-winter-snow-boots-amazon.html><span>←</span><span>The Columbia Ice Maiden Snow Boots Are Podiatrist-Approved</span></a>
