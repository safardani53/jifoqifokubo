In the show’s opening, Gossip Girl herself sent out a blast notifying the UES that somebody was expecting, but the blast never got around to Blair. Later, Blair’s mom confronted her about a What To Expect When Expecting Book — that she found in Blair’s closet — and <strong>Dorota</strong> chimed in and said it was her book!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Congrats, Dorota on baby number two!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>After that, we thought we were in the clear as far as Upper Eastside pregnancies were concerned, but we spoke too soon. When Blair was at a fitting for her wedding dress, the tailor asked her, “do they know how far along you are?” Yep, Blair is pregnant, too! She looked really surprised when the tailor questioned her, so we’re assuming Blair really didn’t know. &nbsp;At this point, we’re definitely crossing our fingers it’s Chuck Bass’s baby!</p><h3>More ‘OMG’ Moments:</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>1. Serena’s NOT Going Back to Columbia!</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Serena left NYC to get away for the summer, but she ended up finding a job as production assistant on the set of a Hollywood movie! Even after being tricked by her co-worker to buy weed for an actor on set , she was offered a full-time gig and accepted! We’re definitely excited to see what trouble Serena will stir up in LaLa land.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>2. Nate’s After Another Cougar!</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>It’s not hard to forget Nate’s love affair with the Countess, who was about 20 years older than him — and it looks like he’s back to his old ways. Elizabeth made an appearance in tonight’s episode as Nate’s hookup buddy for the night, and we’re sure we’ll be seeing much more of her. The question is though: will Nate stay in LA, or will she chase him back to the Big Apple?</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>3. Dan Finds Out Vanessa Stole His Book!</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Dan receives word that a chapter of his book is about to published in Vanity Fair! But the problem is, he’s never let anyone read his book — which is apparently about BLAIR. As we know, Vanessa stole the entire manuscript and sent it to a publishing company, which can’t be good news — especially since Dan went out of his way to contact Louis to stop just one chapter being published. Imagine the disaster an entire novel will cause!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>4. Ivy Lives in LA!</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Last but not least, Ivy — aka Charlie, Serena’s cousin — bumps into Serena at a cafe in LA! Serena of course does not know that Ivy is <strong>not</strong> her cousin.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>What did YOU think about the Sept. 26 premiere of Gossip Girl? Are you as shocked as we are that Blair AND Dorota are PREGNANT?
