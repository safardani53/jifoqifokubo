Gerry told People, "Every time I thought I was ready, I realized I wasn't. Somehow I got it in my head that if you grieve for a year, that at the end of the year, you should be OK. It absolutely wasn't the case."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After nearly three years, Gerry met with a grief counselor: "It was a difficult time," he explained. "I finally decided, 'It's time for me to go see a grief counselor,' because I wasn't sure I was on track. I wasn't sure I was mending properly. It was probably a life changer for me because I remember having two sessions with the counselor, and he goes, 'You're fine. You just got to give yourself credit for being OK.'"</p><p>Gerry eventually "became more optimistic about dating, and it helped," even though it didn't lead to any long-term relationships. He then became discouraged and felt he would never find love again, but with the Golden Bachelor finale imminent, Gerry teased everything "worked out" for him in the end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoyiqmafn6GxprqMm5icoJWhvLN5xaKlmqSVYryveceuo64%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-legendary-pokemon-are-in-pokemon-legends-arceus.html><span>←</span><span>What Legendary Pokmon Are in 'Pokmon Legends: Arceus'?
