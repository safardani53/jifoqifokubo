The role was most famously played <strong>Dinah Manoff</strong> in the 1978 Grease movie, later taken on by <strong>Megan Mullally</strong> in the 1994 Broadway revival.</p><p>Palmer is the third star to sign on for the network television musical event. She joins previously announced castmates <strong>Julianne Hough</strong> and <strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong>, who will play Sandy and Rizzo, respectively. The two roles were famously played by <strong>Olivia Netwon-John</strong> and <strong>Stockard Channing</strong> in the big-screen version.</p><p>"Excited to be joining the Pink Ladies on #GreaseLive as Marty!" <a href=#>Palmer tweeted</a> on Thursday, May 28. Grease: Live will hardly be the Akeelah and the Bee performer's first time singing publicly — she crooned in 2012's Joyful Noise and regularly records videos of her vocals.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The show will be the first of its kind for FOX. The network is following earlier successful moves by NBC, which charted huge ratings with 2013's <strong>Carrie Underwood</strong>-starring The Sound of Music Live! and 2014's Peter Pan Live! with <strong>Allison Williams</strong>.</p><p>"From Broadway to film, and across generations, Grease is one of the most beloved musical stories ever told — and we can’t wait to bring it to our air in a spectacular live event," <a href=#>Fox's Senior VP of Event Series Shana C. Waterman said at the time of the initial announcement</a>. "Its iconic characters and addictive songs make it the perfect fit for Fox, and we’re going to give it the kind of star power and production quality to make every Sandy, Danny, Rizzo and Kenickie out there want to get up and sing along."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKeo5VivaK4zJ6pZqKfnru0ecmuo6KZnqOybrTOrp6hZaaWu6a%2F0ppkoa2UnLKvv4yipWafopqutLGMpaCvnV1nfXKBkXJsaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katy-perry-accused-mom-shaming-american-idol-contestant-video.html><span>←</span><span>Katy Perry Accused Of Mom-Shaming American Idol Contestant Hollywood Life</span></a>
