She styled her new ”do with a fitted black jumpsuit that had silver buttons down the front and a belt around her tiny waist. She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>accessorized</a> her sleek ensemble with a metallic silver crossbody bag, a pair of oversized rose gold sunglasses to match her new hair, diamond ear cuffs and a silver choker necklace.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jada-pinkett-smith-rose-gold-hair-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jada’s new pink hair comes on the heels of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>recent hair growth</a>. Jada revealed in an Instagram post last month that her hair is growing back gray despite having alopecia and she shared a before and after photo of her hair. Jada posted the two photos with the caption, “This here hair is act’n like its’ try’n a make a come back. Still have some trouble spots but — we’ll see.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the first photo, Jada showed off her bald head and put her gorgeous face on full display as she rocked a sultry smokey eye and a glossy pink lip. In the second photo, which was also a selfie, Jada showed off her newly grown gray hair which was still super short but growing in a lot longer than previous times. She opted for minimal makeup in the photo, revealing her incredible complexion.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jada has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been dealing</a> with alopecia for years and she first announced her diagnosis on her talk show, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Red Table Talk</a>, in 2018. Since then, Jada has been open about her condition and it famously made headlines in 2022 at the Academy Awards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5FpZqOZlJZ6sbXNpJytrF2ouqrAx2abnpqlqcBuvs6snGafn6GxbrTAoqlmpZGgsrDCxKtkmqxdoa5usdWepa1loJ28tbuO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ben-barnes-gay-rumors.html><span>←</span><span>Shadow And Bone Star Ben Barnes Gay Rumors Debunked</span></a>
