Helen maintained that she wanted to reach out, but the only thing keeping her sane was sticking to a rigorous routine.&nbsp;</p><p>That was too much for Alex, so he went to play baseball and blew off some steam. Jo listened as he whined about how bad his life was. However, he did admit that she gave him one good year.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about it made Alex realize that his mother is unwell through no fault of her own and that he should be happy about her moving on.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/04/justin-chambers-on-greys-anatomy-627x1024.png><p>He returned to the library and said that he was happy for her. He also asked for a library card because he said he would come visit her. It was a heartwarming scene, but Helen did not feel like she would be able to attend the wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>In her own unorthodox way, Helen was better and doing her own thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Amelia was trying to wean Betty off the drugs, and the pair debated about how she should feel. But Betty was not ready to fully commit to recovery and escaped through the bathroom window.&nbsp;</p><p>This made Amelia attend an AA meeting, and she admitted that she was trying to save a troubled teenager. But she never managed to locate Betty before the episode was over.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/arizona-has-been-ghosted-750x1024.png><p>Meanwhile, Arizona had to contend with a woman who was scared of having surgery. It stemmed from her father dying during surgery when she was 5-years-old.&nbsp;</p><p>The case helped Arizona realize that she needed to put Sofia first, and that paved the way for her to call time on her relationship with Carina.&nbsp;</p><p>Arizona closed her arc this week by calling Callie and saying that Sofia needs to go home with her and that she would be moving to New York.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/meredith-grey-on-greys-anatomy-season-14-1024x739.png><p>The other big storyline revolved around Meredith doing her presentation for the mini-livers. She decided to confirm Marie Cerone was the one who helped Ellis all those years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>But Meredith was not ready to deal with Marie. The reason? The woman tried to destroy her a few months back over what happened in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>What did you think of the episode?</p><p>Hit the comments below.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Watch Grey’s&nbsp;Anatomy online</a> right here to get caught up with all the action!</p><p><strong>Grey’s Anatomy continues Thursdays on ABC.&nbsp;</strong></p><a href=#><img width=900 height=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/jo-wilson-greys-anatomy.jpg alt="17 Characters Who Ruined Perfectly Good TV Shows" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>17 Characters Who Ruined Perfectly Good TV Shows</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WCcLPRnrCsZZGjrrW7zLJkrJ2RqLyveZBtZJ6omai8pbGMa2lmqpWYrrF5xaKeoaxdm7yzediorKtlnZ67pXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-vibration-plates.html><span>←</span><span>Best Vibration Plates 2023 UK</span></a>
