Or that Bill was nicknamed "happy boy" as a child?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, there is something else viewers quickly realized while watching Inside Bill's Mind, and that is that the 63-year-old is also seemingly addicted to a certain soda.</p><p>"Does Bill Gates actually drink THAT much Diet Coke? Or has he been paid butt loads to do product placement?" one fan tweeted. Another noted,&nbsp;"My main takeaway from the Bill Gates documentary so far is WOW he drinks a lot of Diet Coke."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is Bill Gates really addicted to Diet Coke?</h2><p>There is no denying there were plenty of shots of the iconic silver and red can throughout the three-part documentary, and unfortunately, it does not look like it is the result of product placement.&nbsp;</p><p>Bill has spoken plenty of times about his love of the soft drink.&nbsp;</p><p>"Once I’m at the office, I usually open a can of Diet Coke," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on his blog</a> in 2014. "Over the course of the day, I might drink three or four. All those cans also add up to something like 35 pounds of aluminum a year."</p><p>But that hasn't stopped him from drinking the soda regularly.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Inside <a href=#>@BillGates</a> Brain!

Bill Gates is a machine, 14 books on vacation, 150 pages per hour, 90 percent retention... his CPU is fuelled by way too much @DietCoke. Please take care, @BillGates."</p><p>A third chimed in, "So far what I’m getting from the Bill Gates documentary on Netflix is that we’re definitely going to lose one of the greatest minds/philanthropists of our time to Diet Coke."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Saeed Adyani/Netflix</span></figure><p>Others are hoping drinking Diet Coke will make them as smart as Bill —&nbsp;but we have a feeling his intelligence and love of soda are not interconnected.&nbsp;</p><p>"Bill Gates loves Diet Coke and burgers... Okay so do I... so where is my brilliant mind?!?!" one fan joked before another added, "Bill Gates drinking a loooot of Diet Coke in the new Netflix special — looks like I’m gonna develop a Diet Coke habit."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bill Gates is not the only billionaire with a junk food habit.&nbsp;</h2><p>His BFF Warren Buffett is known for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eating Oreos for breakfast</a>, something Bill mentioned in a blog post. "One thing that was surprising to learn about Warren is that he has basically stuck to eating what he liked when he was six years old. He did move past baby food, of course, but he mostly eats hamburgers, ice cream, and Coke," Bill wrote.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"I remember one of the first times he stayed at our house and he opened up a package of Oreos to eat for breakfast.
