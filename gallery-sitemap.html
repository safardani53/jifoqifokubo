Simpson wrote in her 2020 memoir, Open Book, that she and the singer initially stayed in touch after their breakup, but she deleted his phone number after the Playboy tell-all because she was embarrassed what her grandmother would think of it.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1350005699_3-john-mayer-minka-kelly-560.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Minka Kelly]]>&lt;![CDATA[Mayer and the Friday Night Lights alum were briefly linked in 2007.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/John-Mayer-Dating-History-001.jpg?quality=78&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Jennifer Aniston]]>&lt;![CDATA[The guitarist and the Friends alum dated on and off from 2008 to 2009. He admitted to Playboy that he slept with “four or five” women while on a break from Aniston and would “always be sorry that it didn’t last” with the actress. A source exclusively told Us Weekly in 2020 that the exes now “have a nice friendship.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/John-Mayer-Dating-History-002.jpg?quality=78&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Taylor Swift]]>&lt;![CDATA[Mayer and the country-pop star briefly dated in 2009 and 2010. She reportedly wrote her song “Dear John” about their ill-fated romance, which Mayer told Rolling Stone was “a really lousy thing for her to do.” Swift’s response? “How presumptuous!” she told Glamour. “I never disclose who my songs are about.” (Mayer, for his part, reportedly penned his 2013 track "Paper Doll" about Swift.)While Swift attempted to shut down the discussion of her rumored Mayer tracks at the time which fans have theorized also include even more tracks off of Speak Now, including "The Story of Us," "Ours," and "Superman," as well as later songs like "Would've, Could've, Should've" her brief romance with Mayer once again made headlines in July 2023 with the release of Speak Now (Taylor's Version).At one of her Eras Tour stops one month prior, Swift encouraged fans to lead with kindness and not attack Mayer while introducing "Dear John." "What I’m trying to tell you is that I’m not putting this album out so that you should go and feel the need to defend me on the Internet against someone you think I might have written the song about 14 million years ago," she told the crowd.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/John-Mayer-Dating-History-003.jpg?quality=78&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Katy Perry]]>&lt;![CDATA[The Dead & Company member and the “Teenage Dream” songstress began dating in 2012 and split in 2014. After telling Chelsea Handler that “you have to go through all this s--t to get your grips on life,” Perry promised that she was no longer going to talk about her ex. “I don’t want to be rude to him … because it always comes to bite me in the ass,” she told Rolling Stone in August 2014. Mayer, for his part, told The New York Times in 2017 that he wrote his single “Still Feel Like Your Man” about Perry.]]><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn52VmXyorculnKuxXai2tbHMmqdod6OhwqiJyaifp2WdlsamvtJmnZqln6rAbrPIq6Ofqpmau6W%2FjGtnamphZn5x</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dai-mendel.html><span>←</span><span>Dai Mendel- Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Height, Ethnicity</span></a>
