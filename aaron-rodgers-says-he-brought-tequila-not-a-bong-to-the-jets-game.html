After Rodgers went over to say hello to Coles, 31, he ended up dropping the uniquely shaped bottle.</p><p>“I see Hugh, give him a hug, dap him up, go to pick it back up, s–t falls out and I lose half my tequila,” he shared. “So, shout out to John for bringing me tequila, shout out to Maestro Dobel, shout out to Hugh, shout out to bongs everywhere, but that was not one of them.”</p><p>A clip of Rodgers dropping the item went viral and sent the internet ablaze with theories. While many users believed the athlete had brought a bong on the field, Rodgers expressed his disappointment that the guesses weren’t more creative.</p><p>“It’s a little weak with the conspiracies,” Rodgers quipped on Friday. “I feel like it should’ve been something more, like, you know, dolphin semen or Giants tears or something better than that.”</p><p>Sutcliffe, for his part, corroborated Rodgers’ story with a post of his own.</p><p>“We arrived in NY 🗽, and I had to see my friend @AaronRodgers12 to shout Mooooonday Niiiight foootball together and give him a gift @maestrodobelmx @dobeltequila,” the sports reporter wrote in Spanish alongside a video of him and Rogers shared via <a href=# rel=noopener>X</a> on Monday, November 6.</p><p>Rodgers’ first season with the Jets has gotten off to a rocky start. In the first game at MetLife Stadium of the 2023 season in September, the football player <a href=#>sustained an ankle injury</a>. It was later confirmed that Rodgers <a href=#>tore his Achilles tendon</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Thank you to every person that has reached out, called, texted, DM’d, connected through a friend, etc. It has meant a ton to me, and I’ll try and get back to all of you soon 🥹❤️,” he wrote via Instagram on September 13, breaking his silence on what appeared to be a season-ending injury. “I’m completely heartbroken and moving through all of the emotions, but deeply touched and humbled by the support and love. 💔.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Rodgers shared he was making progress on <a href=#>returning to the field</a> sooner rather than later. While chatting with <strong>Derwin James</strong>, the Los Angeles Chargers safety, 27, asked Rodgers when <a href=#>he planned to return</a>. Rodgers patted James on the back and quipped, “Give me a few weeks.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaamaKku26%2Bzp2enqqjYsCixdJmn55lkqe8trPHrWStnaGqtq2tjKemrWWRYq%2BwusZmq6hlpJ2ybrbErapmn5GisnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-seun-kuti-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Seun Kuti Dating Now</span></a>
