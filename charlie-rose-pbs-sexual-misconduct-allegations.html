television interviews.</p><p>Born in Henderson, North Carolina in 1942, Rose got his first big break when he was hired as managing editor of PBS series Bill Moyers' International Report.</p><p>After excelling in the role, he was promoted to managing editor and eventually began appearing on camera.</p><p>Rose’s interview with soon-to-be US President Jimmy Carter was critically acclaimed and won a 1976 Peabody Award.</p><p>He was hired at several networks as a broadcaster before becoming program editor at NBC affiliate KXAS-TV in Dallas–Fort Worth where he was handed the late-night slot which became The Charlie Rose Show.</p><p>Rose was the anchor of CBS News Nightwatch from 1984 until 1990 which featured the journalist interviewing a host of prominent figures including <a href=#>cult leader Charles Manson</a> in 1987.</p><p>His interview with Manson won an Emmy Award that year.</p><p>In 1991, the journalist moved to PBS where his legendary show Charlie Rose has been syndicated ever since.</p><p>Rose's show is seen in 94 per cent of the country on PBS stations.</p><p>It is rebroadcast on Bloomberg's cable network, which also announced Monday it was suspending the show.</p><p>Some of his most famous interviews include Donald Trump in 1992, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 1996 and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2013.</p><p>Aside from his iconic show on PBS,

style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/nintchdbpict000368231299-e1511253510320.jpg><p>Charlie Rose is the latest public figure to have been hit with sexual misconduct allegations.</p><p>The scandal has prompted PBS to halt distribution of his nightly interview show and CBS News suspending him Monday following a Washington Post report featuring accusations from eight women.</p><p>The women, who all worked for Rose or tried to work for him, accused the veteran newsman of groping them, walking naked in front of them and telling one that he dreamed about her swimming nude.</p><p>Rose, 75, said in a statement that he was "deeply embarrassed" and apologised for his behaviour.</p><p>"PBS was shocked to learn today of these deeply disturbing allegations," the public broadcasting service said in a statement.</p><p>"We are immediately suspending distribution of 'Charlie Rose.'"</p><p>Three women went on the record in the Post's story.</p><p>Reah Bravo, a former associate producer for Rose's PBS show who began working for him in 2007, told the newspaper: "He was a sexual predator, and I was his victim."</p><p>She said Rose groped her on multiple occasions and once, during a business trip to Indiana, called her to his hotel room where he emerged from a shower naked.</p><p>Kyle Godfrey-Ryan, one of Rose's former assistants, was 21 when she said the broadcaster repeatedly called her to describe his fantasies of her swimming naked at the pool.</p><p>She alleges she was fired when Rose learned she had spoken to a mutual friend about his behaviour.</p><p>Megan Creydt, who worked as a coordinator on Rose's PBS show in 2005 and 2006, said she was sitting in the passenger seat of Rose’s car when he put his hand on her thigh.</p><p>Five women interviewed by the Post described similar grabs to their legs in what many interpreted as an attempt to see their reactions.</p><p>Rose said that he has behaved insensitively at times "and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate.</p><p>“I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.</p><p>“I have learned a great deal as a result of these events, and I hope others will, too."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>US TV star Charlie Rose suspended
