<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Who Are Alain Vaillancourt And Christiane Girard? Meet Rosalie Vaillancourt Parents</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Rosalie Vaillancourt’s parents</strong>: Rosalie got the Dior Revelation Prize for Complètement Lycée in 2021, in addition to the Gémeaux Award for Best Actress in a Program or Series Produced for Digital Media in 2020. In 2018, Sarah-Jeanne Labrosse and she both joined the Wolfe cast.</p><p>The actress also appears on Radio-Canada’s sketch show Le Nouveau Show, Télé-Québec’s Conseils de famille, her television series Avant d’être morte, and other projects. Rosalie’s career took off thanks to the success of her internet series. She co-wrote this seven-episode series with Charles-Alex Durand, in which she advises viewers on how to get rid of their spouse or wife, played by Pierre-Yves Roy-Desmarais.</p><h2>Who Are Rosalie Vaillancourt Parents? Father Alain Vaillancourt and Mother Christiane Girard</h2><p><strong>Rosalie Vaillancourt</strong> was born on November 13, 1992, in Saint-Hyacinthe, to parents Alain Vaillancourt and Christina Girard. They are the delighted parents of three girls who have achieved success in their own fields. The 30-year-old performer has two sisters, one of which is an activist and the other a feminist. Rosalie Vaillancourt’s parents have given their daughters the freedom and opportunity of doing anything they desire in life. She posted a photo of herself telling her parents she was pregnant on Instagram, and we’re not surprised that it all went down amusingly. Rosalie had already told the media about her pregnancy at the time.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rosalie-Vaillancourt-1.jpg alt="Rosalie Vaillancourt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While her parents are not your average “grandpa” and “grandma,” we can see them in the shot smiling and wearing brand-new sweaters. Rosalie’s father has the phrase “My daughter became pregnant,” whereas Rosalie’s mother has the phrase “Sexy granny.” Her father still wears the t-shirt when gardening, which amuses her to this day. Rosalie Vaillancourt’s parents seem to welcome her wired and eccentric humor and respond in like. Vaillancourt’s parents have always been her favorite people, and they have always supported her in all aspects of her life, both emotionally and professionally.</p><h2>Rosalie Vaillancourt’s Husband</h2><p><strong>Rosalie Vaillancourt and Olivier Auger have been engaged since December 2020.</strong> Unfortunately, the newly engaged couple chose to postpone their wedding due to difficult personal circumstances.&nbsp;The death of Olivier’s father, the current worldwide pandemic (Covid-19), and the news that the comedian was expecting a child all affected their decision. As a result, the couple was expecting a daughter at the same time.</p><p>They announced the news on July 21 during the White Card Evening she hosted at Place des Arts. She subsequently revealed the news on social media, explaining why she had kept the pregnancy a secret for so long.&nbsp;It was because the pair had long struggled to have a child, so she needed time to contemplate things and wanted her fans to have a solid message.&nbsp;On December 22, 2021, she gave birth to Marguerite Auger Vaillancourt. Her kid is adorable, with plump cheeks and huge, wide eyes.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rosalie-Vaillancourt-2.jpg alt="Rosalie Vaillancourt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Rosalie Vaillancourt’s Career Beginnings</h2><p>A Canadian actress enrolled in an elementary school to learn the foundations of basketball and theater. Later at CEGEP, she was forced to choose between her two passions, theater and basketball.&nbsp;She had received multiple sports scholarship offers from US institutions, but she opted to study theater and, unfortunately, was expelled before completing her degree. Following that, she became recognized for her sense of humor and joined the National School of Comedy, which was funded by Phil Roy.</p><p>She was approved right away after applying. After finishing her education, she was featured as the star of the New Girls show at the 2015 Zoofest. She then played Rosalie Vaillancourt: The Musical for the first time on her own at Zoofest.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecClmKKmXauuqrjLmqWcp6WnwW6tzZ1knKCinsC1tcCnnGafmaeus7CMppyerF2nvLSty6KcZq6Rnrmtrc2cpq6qpGK9or7Ep6usZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melwin-cedeno-19641227-html.html><span>←</span><span>Melwin Cedeo (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
