I [pray] your hearing is ok!!!” singer <b><a href=#>Omarion</a></b> wrote on Twitter. Actor <b><a href=#>Rob Lowe</a></b> added, “How can <b>Elon Musk</b> make a car that drives itself, but Samsung can’t make a phone that doesn’t explode in your face?” (Samsung withdrew its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone earlier this year after reports that the devices were catching fire. It is unclear if the man in the video was using a Samsung phone.)&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Watch the scary video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacnZWhvG6z0Z6cp2WRpb2mrdGsZK2nXZeybrXNo6yrnZRir7p5xLGnpaeUnruoecKeo6VloJ28r7GMsGtubmZmhXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-neil-walker-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Neil Walker Dating Now</span></a>
