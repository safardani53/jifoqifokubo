Who knew Tiffani&nbsp;Thiessen was akin to Lord&nbsp;Voldermort&nbsp;in the eyes of these actresses who co-starred with her for years?</p><p>Thiessen came on board 90210 as a replacement for Shannen Doherty, after that controversial actress left her role as Brenda Walsh in 1994.</p><p>Back in 2012,&nbsp;Thiessen told Howard Stern that she and Garth “had a falling out and we grew apart," adding that she was the one who was "hurt."</p><p>Tiffani did not want to delve into any more details.</p><p>When it came to Spelling, however, Thiessen explained that she was very close to Tori’s her first husband, Charlie Shanian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/tori-spelling-on-a-red-carpet-682x1024.jpg><p>When the couple split in 2005, it basically ruined her friendship with her fellow cast member forever, reveals Thiessen, 43.</p><p>“It was a hard situation for everybody. We were close with Charlie [Shanian] … my best friend was Charlie’s roommate.</p><p>"It was hard,” Thiessen told Stern.</p><p>In the many, many years since Beverly Hills, 90210 went off the air, Spelling has mostly made news for pumping out numerous kids.</p><p>All the while, she’s been going through a multitude of marital problems – most of which air publicly – with second husband Dean McDermott.</p><p><a href=#>Tori Spelling is broke</a>&nbsp;or close to it.</p><p>But she has remained close to Garth, even starring for a season with her on a show titled Mystery Girls that apparently aired.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Thiessen, meanwhile, has enjoyed the most professional success of these three actresses before and since their 90210 heyday.</p><p>She was a known commodity before that, starring as Kelly Kapowski on the Saturday morning staple Saved By the Bell for years.</p><p>Tiffani later starred for five seasons as Elizabeth Burke on the USA Network hit White Collar, and who could ever forget her turn as&nbsp;Wilhelmina&nbsp;"Billie" Chambers on the former Fox drama Fast Lane.</p><p>Okay, fair point: most people have likely forgotten about it that … but White Collar was pretty big and SBTB iconic to ’80s babies.</p><p>We’re yet to hear from&nbsp;Thiessen or any of her reps in regard to any sort of response to Spelling and Garth’s latest diss.</p><p>But we somehow doubt she’ll comment.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Beverly Hills, 90210 Cast: Where Are They Now?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>She’s likely moved far past this feud.
