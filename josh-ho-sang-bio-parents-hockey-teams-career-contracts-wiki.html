Josh grew up in Thornhill, Ontario, a suburban part of Toronto, with his younger brother Khole.</p><p>At an early age, the Canadian managed to captivate many hockey enthusiasts in awe, and the pundits even slated him to be better than the previous Jewish players.</p><h2>Josh Ho-Sang Age, Height & Body Stats</h2><p>At present, the Toronto native is 27 years old. Also, Josh stands at a perfect height of 6 feet&nbsp;(1.84 m) and weighs an approximation of 77 kg (170 lbs).</p><p>Being of African descent, he sports an afro-inspired hairstyle. Furthermore, as a sportsman, he is really conscious about his health and hence regularly keeps fit.</p><p>If you have seen him on the court, you know he is the real deal. Swift, aware, and utterly unselfish, Ho-Sang is going to mark himself a place in the history books sooner or later.</p><p>We think it’s a great time to be an Islanders fan because players like Josh certainly provide the thrill and joy to watch such a beautiful sport.</p><h2>Josh Ho-Sang | Career: Teams & Statistics</h2><p>Being a player of color hasn’t stopped him. Despite all sorts of remarks that flow around when you are a person of color, Josh indeed broke the stereotypic barrier when pundits claimed him to be a promising player.</p><p>In 2012, the Ontario Hockey League Priority Selection had a draft, and the Canadian was 5th in the first-round pick. The man was now a Windsor Spitfires player.</p><p>Considered a top-rated prospect, Ho-Sang scored 44 points in 63 games for the Spitfires and received 6th rank amongst the other OHL rookies.</p><p>In like manner, the young candidate represented Team Ontario in the World U-17 Hockey Challenge in late 2012, recording three goals and two assists. Moreover, Josh scored one goal and provided an assist at the 2014 BMO Top Prospects Game.</p><p>Unfortunately, the winger received a 15-game suspension that prevented him from starting the new season with the Spitfires on April 5 of that year.</p><p>The penalization came after Josh illicitly fouled London Knights‘ defenceman <strong>Zach</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bell.</strong> However, after a plea, the suspension was reduced to 6 games.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, Niagara IceDogs traded in their player <strong>Hayden McCool</strong> to the Spitfires to receive the services of Ho-Sang on November 14, 2014. That season, the winger provided 81 points for 60 appearances.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yussuf Poulsen Bio: Age, Parents, Instagram, Stats, Club Wiki >></a></strong></p><h3>Lesson for lifetime</h3><p>During an NHL trial, the Canadian had to leave as a punishment for being late for the first day of training camp.</p><p>This situation certainly was a lesson for Ho-Sang. He led the IceDogs to an 82-point record out of 66 games to make up for it.</p><p>In the same way, the Canadian netted his first NHL goal on March 7, which was a power-play goal against Edmonton Oilers.</p><p>Eventually, in the 2017-2018 season, the winger debuted for the New York Islanders.&nbsp;Within that season, Josh had to report for Sound Tigers on October 25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Josh-Ho-Sang-WIth-friend.jpg><p>During his time in the NHL, he recorded four assists out of 6 appearances. Contrarily, the Islanders called him back for an emergency on November 11, 2017.</p><p>Although his stay was short, Josh scored 8 points in 15 games. Immediately, the Canadians had to report for Bridgeport Sound Tigers.</p><p>Similarly, upon being named the Player of the Week for the Tigers in mid-February, Ho-Sang and his teammate, <strong>Michael Dal Colle,</strong> reported playing for Islanders again in March 2019.</p><p>After being benched, or let’s say being an unused substitute (scratch), the Canadian returned to the Tigers yet again.</p><p>In fact, in August 2019, the New York Islanders asked for the winger’s service and provided him with a one-year contract extension.</p><p>Thereafter, in September, the NHL-based team put up a waiver on him, and thus would sign with Bridgeport Sound Tigers for the 2020 AHL season.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gene Keady Bio: Wife, Hall of Fame, Net Worth, Coaching Career Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>Josh Ho-Sang | Net Worth: Salary & Contract Deals</h2><p>At the young age of 27&nbsp;years, Josh Ho-Sang rocked the international stage with his sublime performances. Deemed a potential prospect in the pro league, the Canadian has yet to disappoint.</p><p>Talking about his net worth Josh garnered a staggering <strong>$ 1 million</strong> and over net worth. His annual salary amounts to <strong>$1,137,500</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/josh-Ho-Sang-Fun-With-Friends.jpg><p>Likewise, after signing a contract with New York Islanders, the Toronto native received a whopping <strong>$3.4 million</strong> every three years.</p><p>As a result, Josh pocketed a hefty <strong>$277.5k</strong> sum as a signing bonus.</p><p>Not to mention, his move to Toronto Marlies also got him booked and loaded. To sum up, Sang’s career earnings amount to $1,312,696.&nbsp;</p><p>While still being the least-paid player on the team, it remains speculation what the young talent will do to establish his place in the financial chain.</p><h2>Josh Ho-Sang | Relationship Status: Girlfriend & Personal Life</h2><p>Currently, the budding star is yet to disclose his relationship status. Simultaneously, we have no source that pinpoints Josh’s romantic life or his sexuality.</p><p>Nonetheless, this section will see an update as soon as we uncover any information.</p><p>Hence, it’s is safe to say that Ho-sang is busy building his career and solely devotes his time to the sport. All we can hope for is the best for his professional and personal endeavors.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>: 17.2k Followers&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>You Might Be Interested In Hicham El Guerrouj: Olympics, Wife & Net Worth</a></p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What happened to Josh Ho-Sang?</h3><p>Josh Ho-Sang returned to the IceDogs as a punishment for being late during the first day of the Islanders’ 2015 Training Camp.&nbsp;</p><h3>What position does Josh Ho-Sang play?</h3><p>Josh plays as a right-winger for the Toronto Marlies.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC2zqyfZqCfYsCiusZmmaKnXaWus7HNrapmoJ%2BYuKbFjK2cmqWjYrCivsSeqWabn6PBs63Crapmr5mgtnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cassidy-shaffer.html><span>←</span><span>Cassidy Shaffer- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
