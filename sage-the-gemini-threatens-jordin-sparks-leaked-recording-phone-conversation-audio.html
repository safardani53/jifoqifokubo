That’s exactly what Jordin Sparks is going through all thanks to a nasty conversation between her ex, Sage the Gemini, and his ex-fiancee.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Everything was f**king horrible,” says the man’s voice on the recording, allegedly Sage. “She got on my nerves. I wanted to stab her. All of that s**t.” Wow.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As the recording goes on, the voice the recording claims to be Sage says that his relationship with Jordin was mostly fake and all for show on social media. Ouch.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>You can listen to the FULL 22-minute conversation above, but know that Jordin isn’t mentioned until the 12:00 mark.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>But, it gets worse. The conversation also alleges that Jordin and Sage were originally set up by their record labels to hype up their new albums. The male voice, allegedly Sage, says their relationship was “stale,” claims that Jordin never laughed at his jokes, and that she was “not no regular person” due to her celebrity.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>So far, Jordin has yet to respond on social media to the leaked recording. It seems she’s taking the high road, just like a lady should!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — Are you glad Jordin and Sage broke up? Do you think that’s really him on the recording?
