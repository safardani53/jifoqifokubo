Whatever damage my daughter was/is going to suffer was set in place 7 years ago,” Derek tried to explain on Twitter.</p><p>“Genevieve is better off without her mother.

Our hearts are truly broken.</p><p>No parent should ever have to go through losing a child, EVER.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She concluded in her message:</p><p>Please keep my family in your thoughts prayers as we navigate through this terrible tragedy.</p><p>Please understand and respect our privacy at this time.</p><p>We are surrounded by the love and support of our children, grand daughter Lyla and family members.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>For his part, Taylor also clarified that he did try to help Jordan get clean… and played no part in her substance abuse issues.</p><p>“Lmao there’s no blood on my hands at all,” he tweeted.</p><p>“I didn’t introduce Jordan to drugs. I didn’t encourage Jordan to continue to do drugs.</p><p>"I attempted to help her and she didn’t want my help.

For a deadbeat mom who was abusing drugs?</p><p>"Society is horrible deadbeat dads get crucified, but a deadbeat mom gets glorified?
