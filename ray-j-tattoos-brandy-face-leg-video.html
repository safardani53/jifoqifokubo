That’s right — the “Sexy Can I” singer got his older sister’s face tattooed on his leg, which he revealed via Instagram on July 5. Alongside a video of himself getting inked by artist<strong> Alexey “MASHKOW” Mashkov</strong>, Ray J explained he plans to fill his entire leg with meaningful art. “NEW @brandy TATOO BY ONE OF THE GREATEST!! @_mashkow_ – IM GETTING MY WHOLE LEG TATTED WITH- MUSIC- LOVE – SCRIPTURES – THE VOCAL BIBLE – FAMILY – GHOSTS – POSITIVE WORDS AND THEMES – REAL GOTHIC LIKE — “THE HOLY LEG! “ – GONNA TAKE A MINUTE!!” he wrote in the caption. “But I got the best doing it !! STAY TUNED!! – FULL LEG TATT — I had to start with my best friend!!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ray J got the seal of approval from Brandy, who left a note under the video <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reading</a>, “Brooooooo,” with several black hearts. Although Brandy and Ray J were clearly pumped about the representation, the new ink got some mixed reviews online. “I love my sisters but no way I am putting [the] face on my leg s— t cringy,” one viewer <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>commented</a> under the clip. “There is no way in Hell I would get my Big sister tatted on me,” another <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a> with several laughing emojis. However, others applauded the gesture, with one supporter <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>writing</a>, “I absolutely LOVE you and Brandys relationship you guys have been my two favorites since way back.” Another told Ray J it was the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“least”</a> he could do after not listening to Brandy ahead of his recent lackluster Verzuz performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ray-J-Brandy-tattoo-shutter-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ray J appeared on the entertainment battle show on June 23 and sang “One Wish” from 2005’s Raydiation, and he did not make his big sister proud. In fact, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she mocked him</a> under a post on his Instagram page which he used to poke fun at his interesting performance. “Since we deleting comments, I will comment again!” Brandy began under the post. “Bro, Pops told me that you didn’t drink none of the tea I made for you. He also told me that you were talking all day when I specifically said NO TALKING and only drink water and the special tea I made for you at 4 in the freaking morning. Caught!!! If I had one wish, you would listen to your big sis sometimes and especially for @verzuztv … but I’m hot … Lord have mercy !!! Smh- when I get off of vocal rest, we are gonna have a serious conversation. And I’m gonna screenshot this comment in case you try and delete it again- and I will post again. Lol.” Luckily, Ray J wasn’t the headliner for this how, which may have made matters worse for him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>June was quite the headline-making month for Ray J. Just days after his unsatisfactory Verzuz performance, the R&B singer was grilled for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eating&nbsp;Nissin Food Cup of Noodles</a> during the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2022 BET Awards</a> on June 26. “Ray J’s life really be as chaotic as it seems bro,” one Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>quipped</a> in response to the scene.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Before that, Ray J and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Princess Love</strong></a>, 37, made headlines for getting back together despite <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filing for divorce</a> three different times. “Ray J and Princess’s friends and family were not surprised when everybody found out that they had gotten&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>back together again</a>,” an insider<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY</a>. “They have managed to maintain a really wonderful co-parenting relationship despite the ups and downs they’ve gone through over the years.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49vZquZqWK3bsDArauop6Nir7OtzZ2wZp6RmLJuuMSgZK%2BhlJq8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-pogues-shane-macgowan-christmas.html><span>←</span><span>Late The Pogues star Shane MacGowan out of the race for Christmas No1 and unexpected group is tipped</span></a>
