Best 9-year anniversary <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> ever.”</p><p>The Los Angeles native celebrated Gio’s 1st birthday later that same month, writing, “You are so smart, loving and so damn determined — I love it all. Gio, you’ve changed me forever, and I will forever be your biggest supporter. Oh, man, my face is raining.

Five months later, she exclusively told Us Weekly about her former costar <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>’s sweet <a href=#>reaction</a> to the news.</p><p>“She cried her eyes out,” Monet said in September 2019. “I FaceTimed her to tell her and she was just crying and it was so sweet and really special. I think it trips her out cause, like, we’ve known each other for so long now and I’m the first to go through this next phase.”</p><p>The former Paradise Run host added at the time: “It was so sweet. I know she was even in a spa at the time and she still took the call and, like, was just a mess. It was sweet. She looked as though she was [mid massage]! I mean it looked that way … She was trying to be quiet, so I was, like, that’s pretty funny.”</p><p>Grande, 27, has a friendship “like no other” with Monet, and she is “of course” known as Auntie Ari to Gio.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former AwesomenessTV host and Gardner got engaged in December 2017 after seven years of dating. Monet gushed about her evolving bond with her husband in April 2020 via Instagram.</p><p>“I used to think I was your biggest fan, but then Gio met his dad,” she captioned a slideshow at the time. “Babe, you amaze me. Every year you manage to get just a little bit hotter, idk how you do it. We love you so much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGadmZ6esq24wGakqKaVqXq4scucpqado2J%2Fr7CMnJ%2BipJRixKrAx2adopmemLJurc2dqZ6vXZyus7DNnqlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aldi-discontinued-product-earth-grown-tenders.html><span>←</span><span></span></a>
