And yes, it involves downloading a second calculator app onto their smart device.</p><p>"If you're dating a guy and you go into his phone and type in the word calculator and he has two calculator apps, he's cheating on you."</p><p>While yes, that is a heavy claim to make, he explains that one of the calculator apps is "a secret photo album for nudes," which is partially true.</p><p>To clarify, the app in question isn't exclusive to nudes, but is often used for that purpose. It can store all types of photos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Both iPhone and Android users can download a secret calculator app to do secret things on.</h2><p>All smartphone users are probably familiar with the built-in calculator app that comes installed on their device. And while it's no TI-Nspire graphing calculator, it gets the job done on basic transactions.

Not only that, but you can exclusively lock audio recordings and music files onto this app.</p><p>Furthermore, the Google Play Store has a similar app dubbed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Calculator - Photo Vault.</a> Honestly, this one seems even more advanced than the former as it includes an "Intruder selfie" feature thats snaps a photo using the phone's front-facing camera whenever the app's password is entered incorrectly.</p><p>Given these apps' features, it does it make it easier for folks who are cheating to cover their tracks.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>However, just because someone has one of these fake calculator apps on their phone, it doesn't necessarily mean they're cheating.
