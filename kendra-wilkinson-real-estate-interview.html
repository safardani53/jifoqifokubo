So I started to hang up my cleats, I kind of retired reality TV. I was in a very lost place and I took a couple years to get on my feet and start real estate.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kendra-Wilkinson-Son-Hank-Grown-Up-embed-2.jpg><p class=x_x_x_x_MsoNormal><span class=markfklg95b7l data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>The former Girls Next Door star</span> is no stranger to iconic Hollywood homes. Now, as a newly minted real estate agent, she must prove she has the hustle to make it in the intensely competitive Los Angeles real estate market.&nbsp; “I got into real estate for so many reasons,” the Kendra on Top alum shared. “I should’ve chosen it a little earlier to be honest with you. But the time aligned to commit to it and learn it and to enter it with the most amazing, most <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>professional real estate</a> brokers out there.”</p><p class=x_x_x_x_x_MsoNormal>The mom-of-two explained how she discovered the love for her newfound passion. “Who doesn’t have a passion for homes and real estate, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>before and afters, fixing up</a>, and house hunters,” Kendra said. “It’s fun to enter someone else’s home and to be a part of the business. To learn how to stage, design, and sell the property and create some new friendships. This is a new life for me. It’s all working out for me and the kids right now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kendra-Wilkinson-Son-Hank-Grown-Up-embed-1-1.jpg><p class=x_x_x_x_x_MsoNormal>“<span class=markfklg95b7l data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Kendra</span> Sells Hollywood is so much different than my last 13 years on TV. This time I actually have a job,” she laughed. “Before my job was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to film a reality show</a> but now I actually have a job. My show documents me entering the business, learning the business, learning who my partners are, and getting to know my new life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Follow Kendra’s journey on Kendra Sells Hollywood on discovery+ as she navigates the Los Angeles’ luxury real estate market.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5BvZqSdnpm%2FonnWoqOkoZ6ovK950Z6YpWWVqMGiwMRmoKeslafDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-vardy-leicester-fulham.html><span>←</span><span>Get Jamie Vardy to score twice against Fulham boosted to 4/1 with Betway here</span></a>
