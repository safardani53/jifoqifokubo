Chaplin told SunSport: “I didn’t decide to leave Barnsley, I was told I wasn’t going to play much as the club were going in a new direction."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I wasn’t forced to leave but wouldn’t have played as much as I would’ve wanted to.</p><p>“I looked for a different challenge and couldn’t be happier than I am now. In league standing, it was a league lower. But in terms of the stature and ambition of Ipswich, it was 10 fold.</p><p>“My relationship with Barnsley and their fans was good. It’s an unbelievable one-town club. I just felt the fans were let down a lot of the time by the board and hierarchy.</p><p>“It’s a buying and selling club. They don’t have a lot of ambition to be winning football games, challenging and bettering themselves.</p><p>“But that is where I’ve landed now and this club is incredible for that and one of the best in the EFL for ambition and wanting to be better.”</p><p>After the club’s relegation to the third tier for the first time since 1957, Ipswich have been rebuilding themselves and making real progress since boss Kieran McKenna took over in December 2021.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in EFL</h2></p><p>The Northern Irishman, 36, is considered one of the brightest young coaches in the game and Chaplin rates him as the best he has ever worked with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/19-AWR-ConorChaplin-IpswichJPG-JS787878493.jpg><p>He said: “I get on with him on a personal level and a professional level. I have so much respect for him and the way he goes about his job.</p><p>“Kieran is incredible as a manager and is the best one I’ve worked for. I don’t want to talk too highly about him otherwise other clubs will want him!</p><p>“He’s great with the lads —&nbsp;whether you start every week or your role is something different.</p><p>“Every single person will tell you he is incredible and so particular in the way he sets up the team. His training is so engaging and replicates how we want to play on a Saturday.</p><p>“It’s the most I’ve ever enjoyed going to training. It’s been the most competitive I’ve encountered too —&nbsp;and I’m talking about tackles flying in and lads really wanting to win. We train in the way we want to play so we do find ourselves in games where it’s easier than training because of the quality we have in the squad.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our 11 v 11 at the training ground is much harder than it is at the weekend because both 11s have top players for this league.</p><p>“That’s something the manager drives. He told me his expectations at the start of the season and doesn’t have to drive anymore because it comes from the players.&nbsp;</p><p>“We know if we’re not doing it in training, our team-mates will tell us first and foremost and if you don’t come up to the standards you are not going to get picked at the weekend.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-AWR-ConorChaplin-IpswichJPG-JS787878303.jpg><p>Ipswich have produced some fine players over the years and the latest one who has shot to prominence this season is 19-year-old Cameron Humphreys. He has scored two in his last two games.</p><p>Chaplin insists that the midfielder is destined for football stardom.</p><p>He said: “Cameron is going to be a top player. He’s a good footballer but his best asset is him as a person and the way he goes about his work, the way he trains every day, his attitude that he shows. I haven’t seen many young players like him.</p><p>“He is really switched on and knows what he is doing. He has had more minutes than he thought he was going to have this season but because of injuries he has been given his chance, which he fully deserves because he has worked his socks off.</p><p>“Even his gym work is second to none. I couldn’t be happier for him. I look out for him because I want him to do well.&nbsp;</p><p>“When you are his age, the fact you’re a good player comes second because you’ve got to show you have a great attitude and are dialled in everyday. He does all that. And despite being 19, he is already a leader by setting the example he does off the pitch.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GETTY_Lincoln-City-v-Ipswich-Town-Sky-Bet-League-One_SPO_GYI1245949038jpg-JS786163472.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBAL</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>L</a></strong></p><p>Chaplin — who won the SkyBet player of the month award for December — believes he has improved as a player significantly since joining Ipswich — as he now can play in two different positions.</p><p>He added: “I love scoring goals. I’m much different from the player to when I was at Barnsley, where I was an out-and-out goalscorer.</p><p>“I’m playing in two different No10 roles — a withdrawn forward or an attacking midfielder. It’s not my sole job to just score goals. Earlier I was No9.</p><p>“Ever since the new boss came in, we played that shape and he saw me playing in that slot. He made it clear that was where he wanted me.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“There’s a lot of responsibility out of possession, lots of pressing and sprinting which you have to do and there is no shying away from that.</p><p>“But on the flip side, you bring your own quality to the position and the team. I've been able to do that a few times.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9yfJJtb3BtX5i8r7vRZpqhmaChtq95yKmqsKGTnXqjrdGnqqWdqWK5pq3GnmSoppVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fernanda-urrejola.html><span>←</span><span>Fernanda Urrejola</span></a>
