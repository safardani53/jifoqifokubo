And they’re so you and authentic.” Haven is the first contestant of season 21 to get a golden ticket to Hollywood!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/american-idol-recap-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Next up is <strong>Lucy Love</strong>, a 28-year-old mom-of-two from Arkansas. She performs <strong>Marvin Gaye’s</strong> “Heard It Through The Grapevine” for the judges. The judges like her voice, but Lionel wants her to strip away all the gimmicks of her performance. Lucy gets a second chance to prove herself and sings Donny Hathaway’s “A Song For You.” Katy and Lionel are on their feet, with Katy even wiping away a tear. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Luke Bryan</strong></a> admits that he had written her off, but Lucy “proved me wrong.” Lucy is on her knees as she gets a ticket to Hollywood.</p><h2>Colin Stough Has The ‘Magic’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Colin Stough</strong></a> is a small-town guy from Mississippi.

Katy gets up from her seat and “fights” Lyric to see if she can show some grit. There’s a voice there, that’s for sure. But can she compete? Lionel thinks so and wants to see Lyric up against some “brawlers.” Luke doesn’t think she’s ready for the competition. Katy is the deciding vote. “There’s something inside of me that’s like I gotta give her a shot,” she says. Lyric is going to Hollywood!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Zachariah Smith</strong> is 19 years old and currently a grill cook at Bill’s Hamburgers in Amory, Mississippi.
