Hot off the heels of the success of <a href=#>Elvis</a>, a new film explores his relationship with his former wife, <a href=#>Priscilla Presley</a>.</p><p>So, what does she think of the <a href=#>Sofia Coppola</a>-helmed film? Read on for the full story, including how her late daughter <a href=#>Lisa Marie</a> felt about Priscilla.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what does Priscilla Presley think about the 'Priscilla' movie? She is fully on board.</h2><p>Although Elvis' ex admitted that watching a movie about your life and love is "very very difficult," she also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> at a news conference for the film at the Venice Film Festival that the director — also <a href=#>related to a celebrated star</a> — did an “amazing job.”</p><p>In fact, she believes in the story so much, she is an executive producer, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>Still, Priscilla is the first to confess that she had her doubts. At the South Point Casino in Las Vegas last week, she also spoke about having reservations.</p><p style=text-align:start>“I was very concerned about this movie,” the star said according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. But as Priscilla also noted about the movie, “I think it's right on, to be honest with you.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lisa Marie Presley reportedly didn't like the way her father is portrayed in 'Priscilla'.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Just months before her untimely passing, <a href=#>Elvis and Priscilla</a>'s <a href=#>only child</a>, Lisa Marie, emailed Sofia to share her dissatisfaction with the script of Priscilla.</p><p>Per Variety, Lisa Marie wrote, “My father only comes across as a predator and manipulative. As his daughter, I don’t read this and see any of my father in this character."</p><p style=text-align:start>She continued, "I don’t read this and see my mother’s perspective of my father. I read this and see your shockingly vengeful and contemptuous perspective and I don’t understand why?”</p><p>Lisa Marie even threatened to go up against Sofia and her own mom, writing, “I will be forced to be in a position where I will have to openly say how I feel about the film and go against you, my mother, and this film publicly."</p><p>Of course, she would not live to see the movie make it to the big screen. Perhaps what Sofia responded with would have come to fruition. She had emailed back to the famed daughter, “I hope that when you see the final film you will feel differently, and understand I’m taking great care in honoring your mother, while also presenting your father with sensitivity and complexity."</p><p>As for whether mom and daughter sparred over the movie, we may never know. It seems clear they were divided on Priscilla. Now, it's up to audiences to determine their own take on the film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXaW%2Fqr%2FCoqOlmV2lv6a%2Fy56wZqyYnrusec6fZKmqmaiwqrjLmmSmp6aesg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-face-scrubs-7968510.html><span>←</span><span>The 6 Best Face Scrubs of 2024, Tested and Reviewed</span></a>
