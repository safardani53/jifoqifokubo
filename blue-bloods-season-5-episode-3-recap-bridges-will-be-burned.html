Danny and Baez had to split up before a new partner could be found for Fuentes, while the case also put Frank’s religious beliefs in the spotlight.</p><p>As a practicing Catholic, people question what he’ll do to find the victim’s killers; Frank ends up having to walk a very fine line between church and state.</p><p>Frank told the Cardinal, in a bold move, that he has issues with the church’s stance on homosexuality, which puts him in an even tighter spot than before.</p><p>As Frank tries to figure out a way to apologize to the church without condoning hate crimes, Danny makes an interesting connection in the investigation.</p><p>One of the attackers is the son of a New Jersey police chief, who wanted to cover all of this up and essentially sandbagged the case while "assisting" Danny.</p><p>In the end, he nailed his man on a procedural point by getting the assailants to travel back into NYC and arresting them moments after they did just that.</p><p>Fuentes and his old partner patched things up, while Frank notably never issued his public mea culpa, and Jamie got revenge on Detective Hoffman.</p><p>Killing him with kindness, you could say, he had an opportunity to steal credit for another case, but made a big display of the fact that he did not do so.</p><p>Follow the link to <a href=#>watch Blue Bloods online</a> and see the episode for yourself, then hit the comments below and tell us what you thought of the episode!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2psX2Z9cK7LrpxmmpykvKW%2FjKycmqufo3p2ecSpoKynlJp6dHnRnpqaqF2Xv6qwxp6qZq%2BZoblursRmma6qnpqxcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-car-battery-chargers.html><span>←</span><span>Best Car Battery Chargers 2020 | The Sun UK</span></a>
