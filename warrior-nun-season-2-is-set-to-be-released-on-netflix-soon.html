<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Warrior Nun Season 2 Is Set To Be Released On Netflix Soon</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Warrior Nun has returned! The Netflix drama is scheduled to return after a two-year hiatus, and here’s what we know so far. However, before we get there, here’s a quick rundown of the show.&nbsp;Warrior Nun is a fantasy series starring Alba Baptista that chronicles the narrative of Ava Silva. Ava, a 19-year-old paraplegic, awakens one day in a mortuary with a heavenly relic lodged in her spine.</p><p>The item grants Ava extraordinary abilities, including the ability to walk, but it also drags her into the world and affairs of The Order of the Cruciform Sword, an ancient militia fighting demons on Earth. Warrior Nun was originally supposed to be a feature film, but after gaining a Netflix order in 2018, it was reinvented as a sitcom. Season 1 of the show launched in July 2020 with favorable reviews. The next month, it was revived for a second season, although production was severely delayed due to the COVID-19 epidemic.</p><p>The wait is now over, as Season 2 of Warrior Nun will premiere on November 10, 2022, at 3 a.m. ET (midnight PT). While Netflix has yet to confirm the number of episodes, it is reasonable to presume that the next season of the fantasy series will contain 10 one-hour episodes, as did the last one.</p><h2>Ava and The Order of the Cruciform Sword will face Adriel in Warrior Nun Season 2.</h2><p>Season 1 of Warrior Nun concluded with Ava discovering that Adriel (William Miller) was a demon disguised as an angel. Adriel’s real identity was revealed to Ava as he touched her after spending all this time in the Vatican after being mistaken for an angel by the first knights of The Order.&nbsp;Season 2 will see Ava and The Order face Adriel once his true colors are revealed to the world. Given that they face a direct foe, we may anticipate the forces of Heaven to take over the Vatican and assist The Order of the Cruciform Sword.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/warrior-nun-2.jpg alt="warrior nun" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the official synopsis:</p><p>“Ava and the Sister-Warriors of the OCS must find a method to stop Adriel, the angel, as he strives to develop his followers into the world’s main religion.”</p><h2>The Order’s basic foundation will be rewritten in Warrior Nun Season 2.</h2><p>Season 2 will see Ava Silva and the other sisters redefine and offer new meaning to The Order of the Cruciform Sword after discovering that it was established on a falsehood.&nbsp;It is also worth noting that the Sister Warriors discovered Father Vincent’s treason, which resulted in Sister Shannon’s death.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/warrior-nun-1.jpg alt="warrior nun" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If they chose to pursue retribution for their former mentor’s death, they may commit a cardinal sin. The teaser depicts Ava and the girls as more cruel and determined than ever as they prepare to take down their foes. Ava is also shown uncovering a hidden weapon used by the first Warrior Nun to defeat Adriel.&nbsp;Despite a significant increase in his popularity and reputation for being unbeatable, Ava is heard accepting the challenge of creating history as she prepares to put an end to Adriel.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Netflix</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Warrior Nun Season 2</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiumqqinryzec2upWarlZbAsLqMa2Siq12osrV506hkm51dp7KtscCsnJ1ln6N6r7HTn6OisF2ovLC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stacy-lattisaws-husband-list.html><span>←</span><span>Stacy Lattisaws Husband: Who is Stacy Lattisaw Dating?</span></a>
