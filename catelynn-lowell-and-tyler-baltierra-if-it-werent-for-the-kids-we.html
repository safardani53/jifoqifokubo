So for me, it was just pure panic," he added.</p><p>"We both kind of looked around. Like, it was just natural without any words. It was, like, a feeling. From then on, we just kind of knew adoption was just the right thing to do.”</p><p>If you’re a longtime Teen Mom OG viewer, then you know that that decision continues to <a href=#>complicate the lives of the Baltierras</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>While Catelynn was still pregnant with daughter Carly, she and Tyler reached an open adoption arrangement with her adoptive parents.</p><p>At times, that agreement has resulted in friction between the two couples, who often disagreed about how big of a role the Baltierras should play in Carly’s upbringing.</p><p>Tyler says the pain of giving Carly up was in some ways exacerbated by the arrival of their younger children, as he and Catelynn were reminded of how much they missed in the life of their first daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“You do get sad having more children after [adoption],” Baltierra said.</p><p>“But then it does ease the pain of not knowing at all what [raising Carly] was like. When we saw Nova get older … we [went] back to old pictures that Teresa sent us when [Carly] was that same age and it helped a little bit.”</p><p>In the end, Tyler says, it was having more children that pushed him and Catelynn to seek help from a therapist — help that he credits with saving his marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“We actually were thankful because it kind of helped … get this thing in check that we kind of ignored for a while,” he said.</p><p>“So we really feel like, in a way, our children just saved us. They came to us exactly at the right time when they were supposed to be in our lives and helped project the healing.”</p><p>According to Tyler, the situation with Carly has grown more complicated over the years, as evidenced in a recent episode of Teen Mom OG, in which he and Catelynn struggled following a scheduled visit with their eldest child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“She’s not a little kid. She’s 12. Like, she has more mature emotions,” Baltierra explained.</p><p>“She’s really understanding the situation that we’re in. For the first time I [saw] her have a hard time saying goodbye, which made me … totally lose it," he continued.</p><p>"It’s a weird thing to want to [comfort her] naturally, organically, and then realize, ‘Oh, wait.’ You can’t because you’re not really raising her. And those are her parents. It’s kind of crazy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Tyler and Catelynn will likely face new struggles as Carly enters her teen years, but it sounds as though they’re much better equipped to handle these changes now that they’re no longer teens themselves.</p><p>And importantly, we’re sure the Baltierras will continue to enjoy the support of their legion of adoring fans!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2Z%2BcK%2FArZylsZ6jeq271p6jpWWRo7FuwNilnKtlkpa5tbXEq6maZZmbeqrAjLCcq52eqXqnu9Fmq6GdXaC2pb%2BMsJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gigi-perreau.html><span>←</span><span>Gigi Perreau</span></a>
