However, five years after their divorce being finalized, the reality star seemed to be back on the dating scene. She met with a man named Robert during the first season of 90 Day: The Single Life.</p><p>In May 2021, Danielle first opened up about a possible love interest with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Us Weekly</a>. She told the news outlet that she felt “happy” to have found someone to talk to about her previous romances, and who was also interested in her.</p><p>Though she didn’t confirm her romance at the time, Danielle said to want “to take it one step at a time, get to know the person and build a friendship with the person first, before it goes further.”</p><p>Nonetheless, things seemed to have “fizzled out” between the two. Since then, Robert has not appeared in any episodes, nor on Danielle’s social media accounts.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH 90 DAY FIANCE ON TLC EVERY SUNDAY AT 8/7C AND MONDAY AT 9/8C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FOLLOW<strong> US ON </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TIKTOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqbmke5hpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJxocWBisaLFjJ%2BgmqaTmsBusMCnoJ6knJp6q67ApaBmqqWotaawjK2mZp2iYq6nwMSrZKKmmqq%2FunnArWSrnZ6WtrS%2FwKeanmWWmsC1tdWaow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-tom-wlaschiha-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tom Wlaschiha Dating Now</span></a>
