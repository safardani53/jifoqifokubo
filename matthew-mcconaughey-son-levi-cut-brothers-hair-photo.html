Levi was standing off to the side while wearing just blue shorts. He gave a slight smile to his little brother as a pile of his locks already laid on the floor. A black dog also looked on.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The memorable snapshot brought on a lot of comments from Camila’s followers. “Looking good boys!” one follower wrote, while another wrote, “Let’s see the reveal!” A third exclaimed, “There is nothing Matthew isn’t great at!” and a fourth wrote, “Love this! We save so much money by trimming at home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Matthew-McConaughey-Son-Haircut-MEGA-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Before Matthew, who is also the father of 13-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter <strong>Vida</strong></a>, cut Levi’s hair, he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made headlines</a> for sharing a funny photo of himself on National Pickle Day back in Nov. He wore nothing, in the photo, as he held a jar of pickles in front of an opened refrigerator and smiled at the camera. “pickled #nationalpickleday,” he wrote in the caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The father-of-three also celebrated Vida’s birthday a month ago. Camila took to social media to share a photo of the party and Matthew’s fellow actor <strong>Woody Harrelson </strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photobombed it</a>. He stood in back of the teen as she stood in front of a birthday cake and wore a flower crown on her head. “Uncle&nbsp;@woodyharrelson&nbsp;is questioning if the cake is vegan or not!!! 🫣😂 how does this go people! Time flies… 13! You are my ray of sunshine Vida!!! Your name explains everything about you “life” (#tb on celebrating her birthday on our family vacation trip January 3rd),” Camila captioned the post in both English and Spanish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5FwZqaZpKm1psOMppqcp56Wwqi0xLJkrKeeYrmmwshmmq6sXZe%2FsMDHnqmsZZiWtrN5z6Gmradf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeopardy-mayim-bialik-megan-loses-ken-results.html><span>←</span><span>Jeopardy! fans spot glaring typo during final round as 6-day champ Megan LOSES controversial winning</span></a>
