Especially when&nbsp;you&nbsp;have long, thick hair.</p><p>But as a sucker to viral trends, I was eventually convinced and opted for the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Mark Hill Mermaid Waver called Style Addict</a>, £16.99.</p><p>I love this device - I already have the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Mark Hill handle</a>, £17.99, and the attachable barrels from their 'Pick 'n' Mix' collection mean you can constantly try new hairstyles - they have 19 you can choose from.</p><p>The&nbsp;3 x 21<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">mm barrel</a> is easy to lock in place, heats up to 185 degrees and has a clamp to hold your hair in place.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>I began by sectioning my hair and spritzing with a heat protector.&nbsp;Starting with the bottom layers, I took sections that were no wider than the barrel and placed them along the prongs holding it with the clamp underneath.</p><p>Normally, I don't style my hair using sections - as I'm lazy - so this took a bit of time,&nbsp;a good half an hour.&nbsp;By the end, my hair was massive - the crimped curls made my hair look even thicker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-25.png><p>As you start from the roots, it immediately adds more body to limp locks.Great for the back of your hair, but it&nbsp;looks weird at the&nbsp;front as it sticks out in&nbsp;weird&nbsp;directions.</p><p>Unlike the Tiktok tryers that have gained sleek, defined waves - I also resembled Monica from Friends with her humidity frizz.</p><p>While I loved the volume it gave my tresses, I was disappointed with the top layer - it looked more static and messy rather than smooth and neat.&nbsp;</p><p>For best results, I would recommend trying either day two or three after washing your hair.</p><p>Fresh tresses mean they are less likely to hold - and for me, by the end of the day, the cool mermaid waves had dropped completely.But for value, I could not recommend more - even if you don't like the results, you can still use the handle with another barrel.</p><p>As for the trend, I think I need more practice... and possibly a helping hand from Molly-Mae.</p><p>It does make for a nice full ponytail though, which is how I ended up wearing mine.</p><ul><li><strong>Mark Hill Mermaid Waver, £16.99, Boots - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2>Molly Mae Beauty Works Waver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-22.png><p><strong>Harriet:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Molly Mae's Beauty Works Waver </a>has been a hit with shoppers since it's launch last year.</p><p>And well, Molly is such a huge fan of the style - it just makes sense she would release her own.</p><p>Its's sold out a number of times, so that's testament to it's popularity but is it any good.</p><p>It's priced at £72; so it's the not the cheapest option in this list but it is packed with extras which i liked.</p><p>The pretty pink waver comes with eight flat clips, and a <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Molly-Mae Pink Beach Wave Comb</a> to glide through your waves for a softer finish; and of course, a glamourous travel case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-23.png><p>I found the clips were helpful when it came to setting waves around my face where I wanted a more defined look, and the wave comb was wide enough to give me that soft look, and not brush out my waves to frizz.</p><p>It's not too heavy in your hand, and I liked the waves it gave you, however I would prefer the wave barrell itself to be wider.</p><p>I found i ended up with a slightly more crimped look than i wanted, and because my hair is so thick, it didn't really give me as much of a defined wave as I wanted.</p><p>You can adjust the heat which is good, as you're less likely to damage your hair, and the waves do last.</p><p>It's a good waver, and if your looking for long lasting waves it's a great choice - personally I just wanted mine bigger for more of a beachy look.</p><p>But at £72, you can definitely find cheaper.</p><p>It's also available at Beauty Works for £89, but is currently on offer at <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Lookfantastic for £72.</a></p><ul><li><strong>Molly-Mae X Beauty Works Waver Kit, £72, Lookfantastic -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2>Mermade PRO Waver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-26.png><p><strong>Harriet:</strong> The <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Mermade Pro Waver</a> has been a huge hit online and is currently all over Tiktok.</p><p>What's more, it's beloved by celebs and has been used by the likes of as recently been used by Hailey Bieber and celebrities from Chrishell Stause (Selling Sunset) - high praise indeed.</p><p>But will it live up to the hype?</p><p>With a huge <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">32mm wave styler</a> designed to create beachy boho waves, I was immediately impressed.</p><p>The caveat to this, it's heavy - and unless like Hailey, you've got someone styling your hair it can easily make your arm ache.</p><p>Like Siobahn, I tested this on fresh hair but i think it would work best on day two or three hair as the waves are much more likely to set.</p><p>I found that the curls near my face were much more defined, and held longer; a combination of easier to style, and longer hair.</p><p><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Mermade</a> say you only need to use it for 3 seconds, and that's definitely correct - as the styler heats up fast and gets very hot, so any longer i was worried about damaging my hair.</p><p>The extra large, triple barrels made easily work of styling and they were more defined compared to the Beauty Works waver , but again as my hair is so thick I concentrated on smaller bits as I was wary of making it messy.</p><p>With these, a brush out and a silky serum for defined waves are your best friend.</p><p>I also found, due to thier size you could easily accidently create a harsh line at the top, but turning them upside down seemed to help here.</p><p>If you have less hair then me, you'll probably find these easier to use, but compared to less pricey models they are worth giving a go.</p><h2>Verdict</h2><p>It's got to be between the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Mermade</a> and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Mark Hill</a> here.</p><p>Depending on what you're looking for, both are attractive options.</p><p>At £16.99, <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Mark Hill</a> is an absolute steal, and you'll be able to use other beauty tools with the styler.</p><p>If you're looking for a standalone styler; then the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Mermade</a> has our vote.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more beauty deals</h2></p><p>On the hunt for new beauty buys, you may want to check out&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Huda Beauty's latest drop.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>From virtual makeup to baby hair sculpting & lash botox –<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;the A-Z of beauty trends</a>&nbsp;you need to know about for 2022.</p><p>For more beauty and skincare deals, stay tuned on our&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beauty page</a>&nbsp;so not to miss out on any sales or new releases - you're welcome.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BwbGxpaGyCcMPEZquroZWZenR5zJ6pppmZmXqprcirZLCZppq%2FtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-vampire-diaries-season-6-episode-3-recap.html><span>←</span><span>The Vampire Diaries Season 6 Episode 3 Recap: The Secrets are Out</span></a>
