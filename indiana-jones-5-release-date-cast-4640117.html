The iconic movie series Indiana Jones&nbsp;will get its fifth installment in 2023. The upcoming movie’s full title has finally been revealed: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first trailer</a> dropped on December 1, giving a glimpse at all the action that’s in store and the dynamic between <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harrison Ford</strong></a> and <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong>. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New footage</a> from the film dropped during <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super Bowl LVII</a> and showed Indy fighting the Nazis. And Harrison gave more intel about the film in a February 2023 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, where he gave his honest reaction to being briefly de-aged in the film.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Indiana Jones&nbsp;5 obviously has&nbsp;Harrison back in the title role, but it will also see plenty of fresh faces to the franchise! The first trailer was screened at <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>D23 Expo</a> in September 2022 and Harrison got emotional as he got on stage and spoke to the audience about the film.&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>has all the details about the new movie for you here!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Indiana-Jones-5-Lucasfilm-embe-1.jpg><h2>Indiana Jones 5 Release Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will hit theaters on June 30, 2023. The new movie will come out over 15 years after the last sequel Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,&nbsp;which came out in May 2008. When the movie was first announced in 2016, it was given a July 2019 release date, via<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Deadline</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>,</a> but production delays and the COVID-19 pandemic set the movie back a handful of times before Disney announced that the movie will drop on June 30, 2023, in October 2021, per <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. Disney gave the first look at the movie back in May 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Indiana-Jones-5-Harrison-Ford-mbd.jpg><h2>Indiana Jones 5 Cast & Crew</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Of course, Harrison returning as Indy is essential for any&nbsp;Indiana Jones&nbsp;movie! As he reprises his role as the adventurous archaeologist, the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;actor will be at least 80 years old by the time the film makes its way to cinemas. Even though he’s getting older, no one could play Indy quite like Harrison could. He made sure everyone knew he wouldn’t be recast in a May 2019 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today</a>. “I’m Indiana Jones,” he said. “When I’m gone, he’s gone. It’s easy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While some fans may have reservations about seeing the beloved hero getting older, the actor did shut down haters during a 2008 interview, while discussing&nbsp;The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. “Just acknowledge the years, without reservation. What’s the big deal? The guy’s 18, 20 years older. So what?” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;in 2008. “‘Aaaaw, he’s older.’ Well, s**t, yes. And by the way? So are you. So…are… you! Take a look in the f**king mirror!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Producers used technology to de-age Harrison in the opening sequence, which the actor talked about in his&nbsp;THR interview. “I never loved the idea until I saw how it was accomplished in this case — which is very different than the way it’s been done in other films I’ve seen,” Harrison said. “They’ve got every frame of film, either printed or unprinted, of me during 40 years of working with Lucasfilm on various stuff. I can act the scene and they sort through with AI every fucking foot of film to find me in that same angle and light. It’s bizarre and it works and it is my face.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Other than Harrison starring, there are tons of new faces for the&nbsp;Indiana Jones&nbsp;sequel. Other than Indy, the cast also includes the likes of&nbsp;<strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Toby Jones, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mads Mikkelsen,</a> Boyd Holbrook, Shaunette Renée Wilson, </strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Antonio Banderas</a>&nbsp;</strong>in undisclosed roles. Mads had only good things to say about&nbsp;Indy 5 in a May 2021 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider</a>.&nbsp;After revealing that he’d revisited&nbsp;Raiders of the Lost&nbsp;ark after being cast, he raved about the upcoming sequel. “It’s a great honor to be part of that franchise that I grew up with,” he said. “I’m in a lucky position where they let me read the script before. And yes, it was everything I wished it to be, so that was just great.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Indiana-Jones-5-Lucasfilm-embe-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>While some new cast members have been revealed, there are tons of stars that fans have been wondering whether or not they would see them again for the&nbsp;Indiana Jones&nbsp;sequel.&nbsp;<strong>Karen Allen,&nbsp;</strong>who played Indy’s wife (as of&nbsp;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) Marion Ravenwood, said fans “might” see her again in a June 2021 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MovieWeb.</a> “Time will tell,” she told the host, but she hasn’t been revealed on the movie’s IMDb page just yet!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Besides the actors,&nbsp;Indiana Jones 5&nbsp;will also mark the first time that one of the franchise’s movies wouldn’t be directed by<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Steven Spielberg</a>&nbsp;</strong>or written by&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;creator&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>George Lucas</strong></a>. When LucasFilm was sold in 2012, the company’s president <strong>Kathleen Kennedy&nbsp;</strong>became a producer on the project, along with&nbsp;<strong>Frank Marshall&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Simon Emanuel</strong>. Even though George didn’t pen the script, the&nbsp;Ready Player One&nbsp;director is still signed on as an executive producer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Indiana-Jones-5-Lucasfilm-embe-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>With Steven stepping away,&nbsp;Ford V. Ferrari director <strong>James Mangold&nbsp;</strong>stepped in for&nbsp;Indiana Jones 5. Frank Marshall had nothing but praise for the Indiana Jones 5&nbsp;director in a May 2020 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider</a>. “His love of the franchise. He’s a wonderful filmmaker. I think he also has a relationship with Harrison. It was all of the right pieces coming together, at the right time,” he said. Besides directing, Mangold also wrote the script, along with&nbsp;<strong>Jez&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>John Henry Butterworth.</strong></p><h2>Production Trivia</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Filming of the movie took place <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>across multiple continents</a>, with shooting taking place in Scotland, England, Italy, and Morocco. The first set photos from North Yorkshire Moors in the U.K were leaked in June 2021, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MovieWeb.</a> The nighttime pictures showed a foggy set with trains and motorcycles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Indiana-Jones-5-Lucasfilm-embe-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>While the movie’s production was finally underway, there was yet another setback when Indy<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> himself was hurt</a> while shooting a fight scene in June 2021. While some things may have been moved around, it didn’t seem to slow the shooting down at all. “In the course of rehearsing for a fight scene, Harrison Ford <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sustained an injury</a> involving his shoulder. Production will continue while the appropriate course of treatment is evaluated, and the filming schedule will be reconfigured as needed in the coming weeks,” Disney told&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>&nbsp;in a statement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>After years of waiting,&nbsp;Indiana Jones 5&nbsp;director James Mangold shared with fans that the movie was winding down shooting. He <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> a response to a fan, and said that there was “about a month remaining” of shooting on January 1, 2022. So hopefully the movie won’t have anymore delays!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/indiana-jones-5-things-to-know-everett-collection-embed.jpg><h2>What’s The Plot Of Indiana Jones 5</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>The first trailer for Indiana Jones 5 was first screened at D23 Expo in September 2022. Harrison appeared on stage with Phoebe and he got emotional when discussing the fifth film. “I am very proud to say this is fantastic,” he said, before mentioning that this will probably be the last time he plays Indiana Jones. “This is it. I will not fall&nbsp;down for you again!” he said with a laugh.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>The trailer begins with Sallah reminiscing about his past adventures with Indy. “Those days have come and gone,” Indy says. Sallah replies, “Perhaps. Perhaps not.” The footage includes plenty of epic action, including horseback riding in the subway tunnels, car chases, and more. We also learn that Indy is the godfather to Helena, played by Phoebe.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super Bowl Big Game TV Spot</a> for&nbsp;Indiana Jones 5&nbsp;features Indy punching a Nazi. So epic! There’s also a glimpse at a digitally de-aged Harrison as a younger Indy. Plus, Indy bravely jumps out of a burning plane with his goddaughter Helena.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>As the follow-up to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which took place in 1957, the fifth film in the series takes place in the late 1960s. “What I love is that we’re meeting him at a different point in his life to where we’ve seen him in these other films,” Harrison said about Indy to THR.&nbsp;“It’s a logical place for him to be at this stage, considering his behavior and what he spent his time doing. It’s a very interesting script Jim came up with,” he added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Along with the swinging 60s-inspiration, there’s been plenty of rumors that the space race will play a part in the movie, giving the action-adventure franchise a bit of a sci-fi flair. It would be incredibly fitting for a movie set in the 1960s to follow a bit of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Harrison also revealed to&nbsp;THR&nbsp;that “old Indy” jokes were cut out of the fifth film. “There is a moment where he observes himself in this situation and says, ‘What the f*** am I doing in here?’ But I hate what I call ‘talking about the story.’ I want to see circumstances in which the audience gets a chance to experience the story, not to be led through the nose with highlights pointed out to them,” Harrison said. “I’d rather create behavior that is the joke of age rather than talk about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8inm6KZnpZ6q7vNnqpmbV2nsq2xwKycZpyRqbJur8Csq2ZsZml9cn2WaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./johnny-depp-opens-up-about-daughter-lily-roses-terrifying-2007-illness-i-didnt-know-if-she-was-going-to-make-it.html><span>←</span><span>Johnny Depp Opens Up About Daughter Lily-Rose's 2007 Illness</span></a>
