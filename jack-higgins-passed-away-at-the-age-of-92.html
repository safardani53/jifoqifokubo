His father abandoned them, and his mother returned with him to her birthplace of Belfast, Northern Ireland, to live on Shankill Road with her mother and grandparents.&nbsp;When his mother remarried, the family relocated to Leeds, where he received a scholarship at Roundhay Grammar School for Boys.&nbsp;In 1947, Jack started his two-year national service. He originally served with the East Yorkshire Regiment, and later as a non-commissioned officer with the Household Cavalry’s Royal Horse Guards Regiment, conducting border protection on the East German border.</p><p>He left the army and returned to college at Beckett Park Teacher Training College in Leeds, where he earned a B.Sc. in sociology as an external student at the London School of Economics. He worked as a driver and worker at night and graduated with honors after three years of study.&nbsp;He subsequently started teaching at Allerton Grange Comprehensive School and took a position instructing in social psychology and criminology. He later taught liberal studies and education at Leeds Polytechnic and James Graham College.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jack-Higgins-2.jpg alt="Jack Higgins" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 1959, the Newcastle native began writing books. His first works were thrillers with hardened, cynical characters, brutal antagonists, and perilous settings. Between 1959 and 1974, he authored 35 books, the most successful of which were East of Desolation, A Game for Heroes, and The Savage Day.&nbsp;In the early 1970s, Higgins’ first small blockbusters were modern thrillers The Savage Day and A Prayer for the Dying. In 1975, he received acclaim with his 36th novel, The Eagle Has Landed. The premise revolved on a German commando force sent to England to abduct Winston Churchill.&nbsp;After the release of Eye of the Storm in 1992, he entered the third phase of his great career. It was a fictionalized account of a failed mortar assault on Prime Minister John Major by Sean Dillon, a cruel young Irish gunman-philosopher hired by an Iraqi businessman.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmpubYrWqs8aipaxloJbAtLHDZpiwmalirrV506GcZpmXmnqwsoxyaWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jinger-duggar-announces-debut-christian-hip-hop-album-straight-outta-tontitown-im-the-eminem-of-arkansas.html><span>←</span><span>Im the Eminem of Arkansas!</span></a>
