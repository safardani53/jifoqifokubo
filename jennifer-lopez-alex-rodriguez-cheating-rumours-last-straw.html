A source close to the 51-year-old singer said: “Jennifer feels she just can’t trust Alex and she doesn’t want to be embarrassed any more.</p><p>"These latest cheating rumours are the final straw. Everyone knows she can do better and doesn’t deserve this.”</p><p>The question in Hollywood circles now is whether Jen, who got engaged to Alex in 2019, will cancel their wedding for the third time, having previously postponed it twice due to Covid.</p><p>Alex is J-Lo’s fifth fiancé and would have been her fourth husband. He was meant to be the happy-ever-after that she craved.</p><p>From her first husband Ojani Noa, who tried to write a tell-all book about her, P Diddy, who involved her in a gun arrest, Ben Affleck, with who she called off their wedding four days before it was due to go ahead, to toyboy Casper Smart, who she accused of infidelity, her relationship history is certainly chequered.</p><p>Pals have long wondered why the accomplished and empowered singer, who is worth nearly £300million, always seems to fall for men who let her down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/f07bfdb5-63d7-47f5-ae9f-af9273218c40.jpg><p>The source told The Sun: “Jennifer just always seems to choose the bad guys and friends are really hoping that this is it, and she can finally choose someone who respects her and stays faithful.</p><p>“She has spent her life building a successful career and a reputation as a strong woman, and the idea that the man she loves can take that from her because of his wandering eye is painful.”</p><p>It was reported on Friday that Jennifer and 45-year-old Alex — nicknamed A-Rod — had called it quits on their romance after four years.</p><p>It followed claims that the former New York Yankees baseball player had formed a close relationship with American reality TV personality Madison LeCroy.</p><p>This is not the first time J-Lo believes she has been cheated on by a man, and friends say she is not prepared to tolerate it again.</p><p>The pal said: “They have been arguing because she just can’t believe this is happening again. She knows she deserves better than this</p><p>“Jennifer vowed she would never put herself in this position again and she was blindsided by the latest rumours. Her rep is saying they are trying to work things out but those close to her would be really shocked if they stayed together through this.”</p><p>At the end of January, a trailer for an episode of Madison’s TV show Southern Charm, about wealthy people in Charleston, South Carolina, showed cast member Craig Conover accusing Madison of being a “home wrecker” because she was seeing a former Major League Baseball player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641304223-3.jpg><p>He said: “You were flying around the country sleeping with men, married men. Ex-MLB players. You flew to Miami to f*** an ex-MLB player.”</p><p>A week later, on the show itself, which was filmed last year, hairdresser Madison, 31, admitted sharing direct messages with a mystery person, but the name was bleeped out.</p><p>She said: “Put me on a lie detector test. I never flew to Miami. He contacted me and yes, we DM’d, but other than that there was nothing. I’ve never physically seen him, touched him.”</p><p>Madison later revealed the person in question was A-Rod, and it was reported she had requested that his name be censored from the show.</p><p>She said: “I’ve tried to be as quiet as possible. I don’t want anything bad for his family, or for mine. We are definitely innocent in this.”</p><p>A source pitched in, saying A-Rod had never “met or spoken to Madison or anyone from the show”.</p><p>But this weekend, after news of his split from J-Lo, another of Madison’s co-stars, Shep Rose, fanned the flames by claiming she had signed a non-disclosure agreement over their “relationship”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000638799729-2.jpg><p>He said: “I know that there was, like, an NDA signed, which doesn’t seem to mean anything any more.”</p><p>Jennifer and Alex issued a statement on Saturday denying they had broken up.</p><p>It read: “All the reports are inaccurate. We are working through some things.”</p><p>And as he left his gym the same day, A-Rod told a photographer: “I’m not single.”</p><p>But friends say the pair, who have four children between them, have been on the rocks for three months and the Jenny From The Block singer recently revealed they had sought counselling during the pandemic.</p><p>She said: “We got to work on ourselves. We did therapy. I think it was really helpful for us in our relationship.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000630069537.jpg><p>Jen is filming the movie Shotgun Wedding in the Dominican Republic, while Alex is holed up at their Miami mansion.</p><p>On February 28 they each posted similar loved-up pictures on their Instagram accounts, but it is thought they have not seen each other since March 1.</p><p>Their last public outing together was at President Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20, where they cuddled and kissed.</p><p>One of Jennifer’s concerns is the impact of the cheating rumours on her 13-year-old twins, Emme and Max.</p><p>Her kids are getting old enough to see and hear what is going on and the last thing she wants is for them to read allegations about him online.</p><span class=quote-credit>Source</span><p>The source told us: “The only reason they’ve stayed together through previous allegations is because her kids are really fond of Alex and she doesn’t want them to suffer.</p><p>“But her kids are getting old enough to see and hear what is going on and the last thing she wants is for them to read allegations about him online.”</p><p>On Friday, a video call between J-Lo and Emme, who was seen being comforted by her father, Marc Anthony — the singer’s third husband — only seemed to add weight to the rumours of a split.</p><p>Jennifer has certainly known trouble in the past where men are concerned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2db2f3d9-0977-4625-bbf1-b8a81530b2f5.jpg><p>Her first husband, Cuban waiter Ojani Noa, planned to write a tell-all book about their 11-month marriage, which ended in 1998, but was stopped when J-Lo took him to court to get a permanent injunction.</p><p>She launched another lawsuit alleging he had tried to sell potentially embarrassing footage of their honeymoon.</p><p>J-Lo began a relationship with Sean Combs — rapper P Diddy — while he was producing her debut album On The 6 in 1999.</p><p>In December that year the couple were arrested in connection with a shooting outside a New York club and charged with criminal possession of a weapon and stolen property.</p><p>The charge against Jennifer was dropped, and Diddy was later cleared of all charges.</p><p>J-Lo later said she suspected he had cheated on her, saying: “I never caught him but I just knew. He’d say he was going to a club for a couple of hours and then never come back that night.”</p><p>After they announced their split in 2001, J-Lo married backing dancer Cris Judd in September that year. They split the following June due to “irreconcilable differences”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000601996044.jpg><p>In 2002 she fell for co-star Ben Affleck while filming romcom Gigli, and he proposed a year after they started dating. But four days before the 2003 wedding they called it off and split soon after.</p><p>Jennifer said later: “My relationship self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.”</p><p>Stability and parenthood came with her third husband, Grammy-winning singer Marc Anthony, and despite separating after seven years of marriage in 2014, the pair remain on good terms.</p><p>She then dated toyboy backing dancer Casper Smart, 33, but there were claims Jennifer dumped him in 2016 because he was unfaithful.</p><p>A source told People magazine: “She kicked him out because he cheated on her and got caught. It happened two years ago and he promised he’d never do it again and once he did, she was done.”</p><p>She got together with A-Rod, who has two daughters, Natasha, 16, and Ella, 12, with his ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis, in 2017.</p><p>He and Cynthia divorced in 2008 after six years, with Cynthia citing, among other things, “extra-marital affairs”. Alex requested that the allegations be struck from court records.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Showbiz</h2></p><p>As America’s best-paid baseball player, he has a fortune of more than £250million, a thriving property business and a glittering media career as a pundit — so he seemed to match Jen when it came to success and ambition.</p><p>An A-list power couple, they share a new 86-acre, £23million home in Miami, have £65million in shares. Last year they failed in a bid to buy the New York Mets baseball team, in which they had planned to invest £215million of their own money.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>It remains to be seen if these vast assets will now have to be carved up — and whether J-Lo will get her happy ending.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">J'S LOVE & LOWS</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/aj-jlo-6way-comp.jpg><p><strong>Cris Judd, married 2001-2002:</strong> Dancer Cris claimed it was love at first sight when he met J-Lo on the set of a music video.
