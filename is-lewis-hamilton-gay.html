To find out, readers should read the entire article.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Page Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Lewis_Hamilton_Gay></span>Is Lewis Hamilton Gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Lewis-Hamilton.jpg><p>Lewis Hamilton is the only person in history to have won as many world championships as Michael Schumacher.</p><p>Yes, both Lewis and Michael have won seven world championships, and he is the first black person to win the F1 race championship.</p><p>And his recent victory was the most celebrated one.</p><p>Formula racers have been the subject of numerous rumours as well as love controversies.</p><p>And Lewis Hamilton is not an exception to these conventions. Lewis has gotten into many legal issues and problems, but this time it is all about his sexual orientation.</p><p>The Internet is becoming overrun with gay rumors, and we’d like to respond to all of them with a single word:</p><p>Lewis Hamilton is not gay but a straight person who loves women.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Do_People_Think_Lewis_Hamilton_Is_Gay></span>Why Do People Think Lewis Hamilton Is Gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Lewis-Hamilton-pic.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=LGBTQ_Communities_Rights></span>LGBTQ Communities Rights<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lewis Hamilton is an ardent supporter of LGBTQ communities. While racing in Qatar, Lewis wore a rainbow helmet, sharing his solidarity to support the rights of the LGBTQ communities.</p><p>Because, mostly in Arab countries, their regional laws are stricter and more inhumane towards the community.</p><p>As a result, while racing in that country, Lewis Hamilton strongly opposed the anti-LGBTQ community laws.</p><p>And similarly, in his Saudi Arabia matches, he wore the same pride rainbow helmet for racing and added that Saudi Arabia’s laws are terrifying.</p><p>This has sparked many unwanted controversies for Lewis, but he was firm with his words and</p><p>He shared this statement in public.</p><p>Do I feel comfortable here? “I wouldn’t say I do,” he said. “But it’s not my choice to be here; the sport has made the choice to be here.”</p><p>But even if we clearly see his statement, Lewis was uncomfortable being in a country whose LGBTQ laws were terrifying.</p><p>Why would a straight person feel uncomfortable over this issue? Fighting for rights is different from experiencing them in real life.</p><p>His statement sounds like Lewis as a gay man. Thus, it was the main focal point for spreading his gay rumor.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hungarian_Issue></span>Hungarian Issue<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lewis Hamilton also severely criticized the Hungary government for its LGBTQ rights before his Grand Prix competition.</p><p>His fight for the LGBTQ community triggered the gay rumors because he seemed very serious about those issues. But why?</p><p>Most people are great supporters of the LGBTQ community, but they won’t go this far, but Lewis did and won the hearts of millions of people.</p><p>However, drawing a conclusion at this point is difficult because we need to see proof to confirm his sexual identity.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Proofs></span>Proofs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Here in this section, we would like to quote some information to prove his sexual identity.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Supporter_Of_Gender_Equality></span>Supporter Of Gender Equality<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lewis Hamilton is not only a strong supporter of the LGBTQ community but also of gender equality.</p><p>And even he has changed his middle name and kept his mother’s name as a middle name.</p><p>Thus, it is clear that Lewis is a man of words and actions; he is not raising his voice to gain popularity, but he is applying his daily life as well.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Lewis_Hamilton_Married></span>Is Lewis Hamilton Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Lewis-Hamilton-.jpg><p>Lewis Hamilton is single as of now after a painful breakup with singer Nicole Scherzinger of The Pussycat Dolls.</p><p>They were in a relationship for seven years and even got engaged before splitting up.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Past_Relationships></span>Past Relationships<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lewis Hamilton has been romantically linked with a few women, including members of the Kardashian family and global singer Rihanna.</p><p>Moreover, Lewis Hamilton has dated these powerful women: Kendall Jenner, Rihanna, Winnie Harlow, Nicki Minaj, and Winnie Harlow.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Lewis_Hamiltons_Rumoured_Girlfriend></span>Who Is Lewis Hamilton’s Rumoured Girlfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lewis is rumoured to be dating his childhood friend and model Camila, and Camila used to visit Lewis’ home; she even took photos wearing Lewis’s dresses.</p><p>Thus, fans speculated that these two people were dating, but this was just a rumor.</p><p>Lewis is single as of 2023.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Is Ryan Seacrest Gay?
