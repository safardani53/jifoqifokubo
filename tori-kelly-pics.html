Tori received a 2022 GRAMMY nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album, was nominated for Best New Artist at the 58th annual Grammy Awards, and took home two prizes at the 2019 Grammy Awards: Best Gospel Album and Best Gospel Performance/Song (for her hit single “Never Alone”) off her 2018 passion project Hiding Place.</p><p>The L.A.-based artist continues to showcase her genre less abilities collaborating with artists such as Jon Batiste, Ed Sheeran, Dan + Shay, Chris Lane, James Bay, Illenium, Lecrae, Brasstracks, and more. In late spring, she launched a popular Instagram Live series dubbed “QuaranTEA with Tori” featuring special guests like Demi Lovato, JoJo, and Alessia Cara. She’s lent her voice to the 2015 signature song campaign for Pepsi, and 2018’s Nationwide commercials.&nbsp; Her voice gives itself effortlessly to the big screen appearing on soundtracks for 2021’s Dear Evan Hansen, The Giver, and Blade Runner: Black Lotus on Adult Swim.</p><p>A force of nature truly singular in today’s pop world with 4 full length studio albums under her belt, 2015’s Unbreakable Smile, Hiding Place (2018), Inspired By True Events (2019), and 2020’s critically acclaimed A Tori Kelly Christmas. Tori can now add author to her already impressive resume as she releases her first children’s picture book, The Curly Girl Blues early 2022. Tori recently reprised her role as Meena in the critically acclaimed SING 2 and is gearing up for the release of her fifth full length studio album.</p><p>See all of the photos of Tori here!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZMGwvshmop6knK56sbXCrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-kylie-kelces-holiday-party-with-fellow-eagles-spouses.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Kylie Kelce's Holiday Party With Fellow Eagles Spouses</span></a>
