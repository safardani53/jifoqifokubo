My wife would go off to work and she’d come home — because I worked at night — and I’d be walking around the couch. And she’s like, ‘How was your day?’ And I’d say, ‘You’re looking at it.’ Just tight circles around the couch,” Colbert said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The comedian</a> said that he was medicated for his anxiety, but didn’t feel that it was effective.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was actually medicated. I mean, in the most common, prosaic way. Xanax was just lovely. Y’know, for a while. And then I realized that the gears were still smoking. I just couldn’t hear them anymore. But I could feel them, I could feel the gearbox heating up and smoke pouring out of me, but I was no longer walking around a couch,” he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, Colbert was 29 and doing a show at Second City comedy club in Chicago that he had created with his best friend, who had since moved to New York. Colbert said he felt a “weird panic” at the time that he wouldn’t come up with anything good enough ever again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I would go to the show, and I would curl up in a ball on the couch backstage and I would wait to hear my cue lines. Then I would uncurl and go onstage and I’d feel fine. Which occurred to me at the time: Like, ‘Oh, you feel fine when you’re out here.’ And then as soon as I got offstage, I’d just crumble into a ball again. Nobody ever asked me what was wrong!” he said, laughing. “It went on for months.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: 7 Times <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Selena Gomez</a> Spoke Up About Mental Health</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Soon after, Colbert realized that performing was what made him calm and happy, and to focus on doing that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I stopped the Xanax after, like, nine days. I went, ‘This isn’t helping.’ So I just suffered through it. I’d sometimes hold the bottle, to go like, “I could stop this feeling if I wanted, but I’m not going to. Because I know if I stop the feeling, somehow I’m not working through it, like I have got to go through the tunnel with the spiders in it.’ And then one morning I woke up and my skin wasn’t on fire, and it took me a while to figure out what it was.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wake up the next morning, I’m perfectly fine, to the point where my body’s still humming. I’m a bell that’s been rung so hard that I can still feel myself vibrating. But the actual sound was gone [because] I was starting rehearsal that day to create a new show,” he continued. “And then I went, ‘Oh, my God, I can never stop performing.’ Creating something is what helped me from just spinning apart like an unweighted flywheel. And I haven’t stopped since. Even when I was a writer I always had to be in front of a camera a little bit. I have to perform.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Colbert said that comedy saved his life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m so grateful. Comedy was my savior as a child. And still [is],” he said. “Last night, I went home and murdered a pint of ice cream and I watched three episodes of Veep. Season Two. It was fantastic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2iqrZ2gnbKvecKoo5udoql6orrXopytsV2jsrPCzq6qZpqimq6ssM6wpWallZm2pK3ToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./family-reunites-with-lost-dog-at-pet-adoption-event-7509925.html><span>←</span><span>Family Reunites With Lost Dog While Looking for New Pet at Adoption Event</span></a>
