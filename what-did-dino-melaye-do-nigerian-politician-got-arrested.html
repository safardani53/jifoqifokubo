Nigerian Politician Got Arrested</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>The detention of Dino Melaye</strong> has exploded across the Internet. The article below discusses the current political climate in Nigeria. Born on January 1, 1974, Dino Melaye is a politician, activist, and former senator from Nigeria. Known for his outspokenness and activism, he is a controversial figure.</p><p>An inhabitant of Ayetoro Gbede in the Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State, Melaye was also a member of the eighth Nigerian National Assembly. Dino is well-known for his criticism of the government and his advocacy for various causes. He has participated in protests against corruption and human rights violations and advocated for greater government accountability and transparency.</p><h2>Is Dino Melaye Being Held?</h2><p>No, <strong>Dino Melaye</strong> has not been detained as of the writing of this article; however, the politician’s detention has been demanded. Monday’s statement was issued by the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council (APC PCC).&nbsp;Dele Alake, the APC PCC’s Advisor on Media, Communications, and Public Affairs, has demanded that Dele Momodu of the PDP be apprehended. Along with Melaye, the council has requested that Dele Momodu be apprehended.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dino-Melaye.jpg alt="Dino Melaye" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>To illustrate, Melaye and Momodu are the opposition Peoples Democratic Party’s spokespersons. In addition, the council has requested that the Department of State Services invite the Senior Pastor of Dunamis Church, Paul Enenche, for his “inspiring sermon” last Sunday.&nbsp;Alake asserted that the three defendants disrupted the electoral process and incited violence through threats and hate speech.</p><p>In addition, Alake expressed the APC’s confidence in winning the 2023 presidential election at a media conference. Alake cautioned the PDP to adhere to the rule of law and allow INEC to perform its duties without interference. He asserted that the APC would not be intimidated by any competing political party.</p><h2>What happened to Dino Melaye, and where is he now?</h2><p>According to the APC PCC, Dino Melaye has been accused of making incendiary statements that could exacerbate tensions in the nation. Dino Melaye, the People’s Democratic Party’s (PDP) collation agent, is presently agitating against the collation and publication of results.&nbsp;The former lawmaker disputes the legitimacy of every result presented by the State Collation Officers. He is requesting that the results from the polling units be posted on the INEC website so they can be compared with the results presented by the state’s collation officers.&nbsp;Following Melaye’s action, INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu attempted to calm him down, telling him, “Dino, you are now being deliberately obstructive.”</p><h2>Career</h2><p>The politician attended Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Nigeria, to study geography. After graduation, he spent several years in the private sector before entering politics.&nbsp;From 2015 to 2019, Melaye represented Kogi West Senatorial District in the Nigerian Senate.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dino-Melaye-2.jpg alt="Dino Melaye" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Before becoming a senator, he represented Kabba/Bunu/Ijumu Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011. Melaye was elected to the House of Representatives of Nigeria in 2007 and re-elected in 2011.&nbsp;The politician was also the chairman of the House Information, National Orientation, Ethics, and Values Committee.&nbsp;Melaye was detained and accused of unlawful firearm possession in 2018. In 2020, the charges were withdrawn due to a lack of evidence, and he was subsequently released on bond.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGqsIydoKenXaKyra3YnmSdp12jtqix0aKYp2WgpLmqwMicoJqmXZy8tXnAq6meq6SasXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ulysses-benitez.html><span>←</span><span>Ulysses Benitez</span></a>
