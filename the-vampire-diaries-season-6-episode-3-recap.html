What does she want?</p><p><strong>Stefan</strong>, meanwhile, returned to town in order to get revenge against Enzo. But just as he was about to kill his enemy, one of the guys in Matt’s weird group came upon them with a crossbow. Enzo killed him first, but not before <strong>Matt learned</strong> that he’s been training with a group of vampire hunters.</p><p>Oops! His bad!</p><p><strong>Tyler called Liv</strong> in to help with the body and the kegs and she admitted she has feelings for him. We’re totally down with Lyler, aren’t you? (Or should we refer to them as Tiv?)</p><p>Finally, Enzo went for a piece of pie at the diner and ended up sitting next to <strong>Tripp</strong>. He knew Enzo was a vampire because Enzo has been killing waitresses left and right.</p><p>Tripp injected Enzo with vervain, but Enzo was able to fight it off and was about to kill Tripp… when Stefan walked in and shot him twice with that crossbow. He introduced himself to Tripp <strong>as another Founding Family member</strong> and was about to put another stake through Enzo when Tripp said he likes to kill vampires in his own way.</p><p>So Stefan told him to go ahead and do so. As long as he makes it painful.</p><p>Lots of forward momentum this week, lots of revelations and a few major questions regarding the idenities of Sarah and Kai.</p><p>Go <a href=#>watch The Vampire Diaries online</a> via TV Fanatic if you need to catch up and check out the official promo here for <a href=#>The Vampire Diaries Season 6 Episode 4</a>, "Black Hole Son."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2psX2Z9cMDHnmSvmZ2ltrOxjJ2gmqqZmsBuv8SaqqimXWt6przIrKadnV1oerOxwpqnaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-simmonds.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Simmonds</span></a>
