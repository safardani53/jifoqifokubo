So we want to feel that part being fulfilled, being loved.</p><p>Even though Silva's favorite scenes of Tarlos were when they had intimate moments through conversations, he understood what their fans wanted.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Rafael Silva and Ronen Rubinstein on Tarlos&nbsp;</h2><p>In June 2021, Silva and Rubinstein discussed the future of Tarlos in an <a href=# rel="follow noopener">interview with E.T.

He officially came out years ago, but it is unknown if he has a boyfriend or a husband.&nbsp;</p><p>In April 2021,&nbsp;Rubinstein also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">came out as bisexual</a>. His work as an actor helped him identify himself as a part of the LGBTQ+.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Ronen Rubinstein. (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</strong></p><p>He realized he was bisexual when he was young and was more aware of it in high school. But he was scared to embrace it because of the hate he expected to get.&nbsp;</p><p>But playing a gay character like T.K. helped Rubinstein accept himself and his orientation. Similarly, he also credited his co-star Silva for helping him to speak his truth.&nbsp;</p><p>And now, he is loud and proud to be a part of the LGBTQ+&nbsp;community.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKqRm66muIysoKWukWK0osWNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-snider.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Snider (musician)</span></a>
