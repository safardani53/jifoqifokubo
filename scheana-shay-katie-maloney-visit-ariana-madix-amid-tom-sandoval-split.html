Doute, 40 — who dated the TomTom co-owner, 39, from 2007 to 2013 — was photographed carrying a bottle of wine and a bouquet of flowers after parking her car at the former SUR bartender’s house.</p><p>The Pump Rules alum later shared a video of herself <a href=#>hugging and kissing Madix</a>, 37, who appeared emotional in the clip. “I stan Ariana. This is in real-time. I love you so much,” Doute shared via her Instagram Stories on Friday. “I love you more than anything. You’re my girl.”</p><p>Shay, 37, showed up at Madix’s home on Friday in lilac-colored sweatpants and a white bucket hat. She also shared footage with the Florida native later that night, posting a clip of <a href=#>Madix dancing and singing</a> while seemingly at <strong>Tove Lo</strong>’s concert at the Wiltern in Los Angeles.</p><p>“We rally,” Shay captioned the video, which featured Madix singing along to the “Habits” singer’s “Cool Girl”: “I’m a, I’m a, I’m a cool girl, I’m a, I’m a cool girl / Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy,” Madix sang to the camera, rolling her eyes along with the song.</p><p>Maloney, for her part, also came through for her friend, wearing an all-black ensemble and dark sunglasses. She, too, got candid about where she stands amid the drama via social media. (Maloney announced her split from ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a> in March 2022. That August, the Schwartz & Sandy’s cofounder <a href=#>hooked up with Leviss</a>, 28, at Shay and Brock Davies’ wedding.)</p><p>In response to Madix and Sandoval’s split — and his tryst with Leviss — the Ohio native took to her Instagram Stories to share several telling messages, including one with two clown emojis.</p><p>“It’s never going to be about tom again,” Maloney wrote in response to a fan account supporting her and Madix. She also penned, “Just you f—king wait” in response to an account who wanted to see her and Madix “burn it all down.”</p><p>Sandoval, for his part, was performing with his band, Tom Sandoval & the Most Extras in Anaheim on Friday night. An eyewitness exclusively told Us that the restauranteur asked the crowd, “Have you ever been <a href=#>one of the most hated people in America</a>?” After the audience began to heckle him with chants of “Ariana!” the eyewitness told Us that Sandoval said, “We love her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source told Us on Friday that the twosome, who<a href=#> began dating in 2014</a>, “were having problems for a while,” though the relationship “only came to a<a href=#> breaking point</a>” on Thursday, March 2.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Shay, Maloney and Doute supporting Madix:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKS0xJqlmmWjna66ecqaq6KdXaKurbvNnrBmrpmotrV5wKugmqaRYrqisMixZJqlmZl6tbvMZqqappSkw6K4jKynpaGkZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jared-leto-miley-cyrus-hooking-up-sex.html><span>←</span><span>Jared Leto &amp;amp; Miley Cyrus Hooking Up?
