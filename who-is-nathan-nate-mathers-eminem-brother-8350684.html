In 2004, when Nathan was still living with Eminem, the rapper opened up to Rolling Stone about seeing his brother go in and out of foster homes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I watched him when he was in the foster home. He was so confused. I mean, I cried just going to see him at the foster home,” Eminem recalled. “The day he was taken away, I was the only one allowed to see him. They had come and got him out of school. He didn’t know what the f— was going on. The same thing that had happened in my life was happening in his.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued: “It was like, ‘Man, if I get in position, I’m gonna stop all this s—.’ And I got in position and did.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hes-a-dj-music-producer-and-actor></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He’s a DJ, music producer and actor</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Nathan 'Nate' Mathers.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nathan Mathers Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like his brother, Nathan works in the entertainment industry.

The couple have not shared how they met or when they started dating, but according to one of Ashley’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram posts</a>, they have known each other for many years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In my favorite place with my favorite guy celebrating my favorite number,” she wrote in May 2022 for their fourth wedding anniversary. “4 years married to you.

[It] fit perfect!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nathan also said that he even went so far as to bleach his hair to match Eminem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When I was 12 and went to your dad’s first show … my cousin John convinced me, going to his show, that not only should I dye my hair, [but] that my brother, your dad, dyes his eyebrows,” he recalled. “Being young I’m like, ‘Oh really? I wanna dye my eyebrows too. Sounds like a perfect idea. I wanna look like twins.’ Not the case.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Hailie noted that Eminem didn’t dye his eyebrows, Nathan joked, “I looked like a ferret!”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6edvG610malmqyYlrtuusCtnGalkam1pr7SZpymoZ6aum6u0airoZ2iYoV0gY9vb20%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sabrina-quesada.html><span>←</span><span>Sabrina Quesada Age, Height, Net Worth, Parents, Boyfriend, Wiki</span></a>
