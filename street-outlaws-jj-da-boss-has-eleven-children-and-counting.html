Only four of his children are from his current relationship with Tricia, as he had seven children with his previous partner.</p><p>JJ’s partner Tricia is also involved in the Memphis racing community, so the pair together certainly are a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>There is not much information available about most of his children, as, by the looks of his Instagram, they are all very young. However, his son, Josh Day is almost just as well known as himself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JJDABOSS (@jj_da_bossmso)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jj-da-boss-son>JJ Da Boss’ son</h2><p>Josh Day A.K.A Doughballs is the oldest out of JJ’s sons and is heavily involved in the racing scene himself. Although he wasn’t a racer on the show, he got noticed for being JJ Da Boss’s son, as he manages most of Street Outlaws.</p><p>He has recently taken a break from the show due to an injury. His father revealed to the public that Josh had injured a disc in his back, and couldn’t attend the filming for Street Outlaws:&nbsp;Memphis&nbsp;season five.</p><p>However, as of 2022, Josh has still not made a return to filming and has not confirmed when he will be back.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JJDABOSS (@jj_da_bossmso)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-keep-up-with-jj-da-boss-on-instagram>Keep up with JJ Da Boss on Instagram</h2><p>It’s no surprise that JJ already has quite the fan base on his Instagram. The Street Outlaws star has 187k followers, and he updates fans on all the latest in his hectic life.</p><p>From race days out to school runs, he also boasts about his children across his social media.</p><p>It’s clear from his posts how much his children truly mean to him, and in September 2021 he captioned a photo of his daughters Vada and Aubrey saying: “After school, they wanted to ride, so we saddle up the horse every step they took my heart melted. My baby girls are growing up. ♥️&nbsp;If I could only live a 100 years to protect them”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JJDABOSS (@jj_da_bossmso)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH STREET OUTLAWS AMERICA’S LIST ON MONDAYS AT 8 PM ET ON DISCOVERY</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdno6m%2FprHTZqaurJyWxLR5yaNknZldl7y0v4yhmKxllaGyt7HNZpqhoZyZv6a6jJqlnWWTpMKvwMinng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-hollywood-bake-off-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Paul Hollywood and what is the Bake Off judges net worth?
