Sometimes, a meme's meaning or when you're supposed to use it is confusing, and sometimes, the origin of a particular image or format only makes things more unclear.</p><p>One of the newer memes that is frustrating many across the web, and delighting just as many, is the "Why Did Jake Do That?" meme, which focuses on an image from the animated series <a href=#>Adventure Time</a>. Now that the meme format is becoming more and more popular, people want to know about its origins.

Users on TikTok began to use the meme, and paired it with the phrase "Why did Jake do that," which is how the two became linked.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Know Your Meme</a>, the trend is based on an earlier trend called "Why Did SpongeBob Do That" which is obviously focused on an image from SpongeBob SquarePants. The SpongeBob version involves a scene with Mrs. Puff in which SpongeBob hypnotizes her.</p><p>After the video was posted on Twitter and gained a sizable audience, other TikTok users started to riff on it in interesting ways. One user made the scene feel ominous and creepy, while another paired audio from the scene with their own drawings of it, and yet another turned it into a silent movie.</p><p>In that way, users on TikTok were able to bring their own creativity to a trend that was already gaining traction on the platform.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The TikTok generation is exactly the right age for 'Adventure Time.'</h2><p>Although TikTok is used by people of all ages, it's certainly most popular among teenagers and people in their 20s, which might explain why memes from Adventure Time are now popping up on the platform. The show was popular with kids in the 2010s, and now they are spitting that culture back up in the form of memes and other forms of content.</p><p>Like TikTok itself, Adventure Time attracted a fairly broad audience. Ultimately, though, the "Why Did Jake Do That" meme makes sense in part because of who Adventure Time's primary audience was when it aired.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aikaCybrDOZquhmaRiuqa5xA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-crystle-stewart-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Crystle Stewart Dating Now</span></a>
