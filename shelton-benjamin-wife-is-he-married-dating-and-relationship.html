There is no information online regarding his marriage with anyone. Therefore, it would be safe to assume that Shelton Benjamin has not been married and does not have a wife.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the wrestler was previously involved with a woman named Dana Massengale. He has a daughter named Kyana with Dana.&nbsp;</p><p>Except that, Shelton’s name has not been linked with other women. The wrestler prefers to keep his personal information under wraps.&nbsp;</p><p>Even his social media site provides no insight into his relationships.&nbsp;</p><h3>Shelton Benjamin Kids</h3><p>Shelton has two daughters named Kyana and Ash, and he is very close with them. He often posts about them and proudly celebrates their achievements on his social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Kyana Benjamin is the elder daughter, born to her father, Shelton Benjamin, and her mother, Dana Massengale. She graduated high school in 2017 from Lubbock High School in Texas.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kyana-Benjamin.jpg><p>Later, she&nbsp;attended Willamette University for a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and International Studies.&nbsp;Kyana is currently a <a href=# rel=noopener>full-time student</a> at the New Mexico State University, where she is pursuing a Master’s degree in Mental Health Counseling.&nbsp;</p><p>Kyana inherited athletic genes from her father. She played volleyball during her high school and college years. In&nbsp;her high school career, she earned Academic All-District and Academic All-State honors and was chosen as Lubbock’s team MVP.</p><p>Similarly, Shelton’s younger daughter, Ash, graduated high school in 2022. She is currently 19 years old. Unlike her elder sister, not much is known about Ash.&nbsp;</p><h2>Did Shelton Benjamin leave WWE?</h2><p>Recently, on September 21, 2023, Shelton wrote on Twitter,</p><p>”I have been released from my WWE contract. I thank WWE staff, talent, and, of course, the fans for everything. Something ends something new begins. Looking forward to my next chapter.”</p><p>However, Benjamin wasn’t the only one that WWE released on September 21. Other wrestlers like&nbsp;Mustafa Ali, Rick Boogs, Aliyah, Tegan Nox, Emma, Riddick Moss, etc., were also released on the same date as him.&nbsp;</p><p>These releases by WWE occurred as part of a series of layoffs that followed the merger of WWE with UFC into TKO Group Holdings. The layoffs appear to be a cost-cutting measure or a restructuring effort by the company.&nbsp;</p><h2>Frequently Asked Question</h2><h3>Who is Shelton Benjamin Wife?</h3><p>There is no mention of Shelton Benjamin wife because Shelton is currently reported to be single.
