I’d also recommend rosemary, thyme, mint and oregano.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>How to store food right</h2><p>STORING your food right means less waste and more money saved. Here are my tips.</p><p><strong>POTATOES: </strong>These should be stored in a cool, dry, dark place – preferably in a paper sack or cloth bag.</p><p>They should NEVER be stored near onions as this can cause them to sprout. Also, putting an apple in with the potatoes helps to keep them fresh.</p><p><strong>GARLIC: </strong>This can be stored in the same way as potatoes, but the easiest way to keep garlic fresh is to throw the peeled cloves in a food processor with a little water and then freeze the puree in an ice cube tray.</p><p>Once frozen, you can pop the cubes out and save them in a freezer bag.</p><p><strong>GINGER: </strong>Can be frozen as is, then just cut off what you need when you need it, popping the rest straight back into the freezer.</p><p><strong>ONIONS: </strong>These can be chopped and frozen, but will also keep for months if you put them into the leg of an old pair of sheer tights. Simply pop one in and then twist the tights before adding another.</p><p>Challenge yourself and see how many you can fit in one leg! Tie with string and hang up somewhere cool, dry and dark.</p><p><strong>SPRING ONIONS: </strong>These are best stored with the roots in a small amount of water in a glass. Stick the glass on the windowsill next to your homegrown herbs.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Sausage chilli with creamy chive crushed potatoes</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>5 mins prep</strong><br><strong>15 mins cooking</strong><br><strong>Serves 4</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000639837449.jpg><p><strong>YOU NEED:</strong></p><ul><li>1kg new potatoes, skins on, thickly sliced</li><li>8 sausages</li><li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li><li>200g frozen mixed peppers</li><li>200g frozen Mediterranean veg</li><li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li><li>1 tsp ground coriander</li><li>1 tsp chilli powder</li><li>1 tsp ground cumin</li><li>1 x 400g tin red kidney beans</li><li>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li><li>2 tsp sugar</li><li>5 tbsp plain yoghurt</li><li>20g fresh chives, snipped</li></ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p><li>Put the potatoes on to boil for 10 minutes, until tender.</li><li>Meanwhile, squeeze three balls of meat from each sausage (discarding the skins), then fry in the oil for 5 minutes, until lightly browned all over.</li><li>Add the peppers and veg to the pan with the meatballs, then fry for 4 minutes more.</li><li>Tip in the garlic and spices, fry for 1 minute, then mix in the beans (drained and rinsed), tomatoes and sugar.</li><li>Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the saucy and meatballs are cooked.</li><li>Meanwhile, drain the potatoes, then mash in the pan.

If you are making a curry, dice the chicken before freezing it to save time later on.</p><p><strong>ROASTING VEG:</strong> If you intend on roasting fresh veg, including potatoes, then make sure you parboil them first for minimal oven time. And while you’re doing that, heat the roasting tray and oil in the oven to make maximum use of your 20 minutes.</p><p><strong>SLOW COOKING: </strong>For a quick and easy mid-week dinner, your slow cooker is key. Invest some time in the evening to prep the ingredients for the next day’s dinner and put them in the fridge. Tip into the slow cooker in the morning and come home to a tasty ready-made meal in the evening.</p><p><strong>PASTA WITH VEG: </strong>If you are cooking pasta and adding veg to the dish, cook the pasta and veg together in the one pan – less washing up at the other end!</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p><strong>PANCAKES:</strong> Prepare pancake batter the night before and store in the fridge overnight – this works for Yorkshire puds, too.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p><strong>VEG PREP: </strong>Fresh veg and potatoes can be peeled and prepped the night before and stored in a pot with cold water and a lid.
