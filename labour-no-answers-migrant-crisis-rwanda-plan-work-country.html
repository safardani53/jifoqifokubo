few dozen illegal migrants on it was due to take off to <a href=#>Rwanda</a>, central Africa, <a href=#>it was stopped at the last minute</a> by meddling human rights lawyers and left-wing activists.</p><p>All appealing to an <a href=#>anonymous judge in Strasbourg.</a></p><p>As I say, it is interesting because these people who talk of laws pay no attention to our own laws.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MIGRANT CRISIS">READ MORE ON MIGRANT CRISIS</h2><p>They do not seem to think it even a subject of interest that <a href=#>40,000 people came across the Channel illegally</a> last year alone.</p><p>That is 40,000 people breaking the law.</p><p>Our law.</p><h2>Piece of stupidity</h2><p>The open-borders Left always tries to pretend that everyone who breaks the law by entering this country illegally from <a href=#>France</a> is an asylum seeker.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>They couldn’t be more wrong.</p><p>Most have no legal right to be in the UK.</p><p>All have travelled through <a href=#>multiple safe countries before heading here.</a></p><p>They come to Britain not because it is the only place they can flee to but because they believe it is the most comfortable country to be in.</p><p>As similar border crises in <a href=#>Australia</a>, <a href=#>Europe</a> and <a href=#>America</a> have shown, there is only one way to stop such flows of people.</p><p>And only one certain way to make sure that the numbers do not grow.</p><p>That way is to deter people.</p><p>To make it clear they are breaking the law and that if they spend their time and <a href=#>money</a> trying to break our laws it will be pointless.</p><p>That is one of the things that makes the Rwanda plan so important.</p><p>It will discourage people from<a href=#> paying smuggler gangs to bring them from France to Britain.</a></p><p>It will encourage them to realise that if they get to our shores they will not stay.</p><p>Of course, the open-borders, know-nothing Left has decided that sending people to Rwanda is like sending them to a Nazi death camp.</p><p>We already know that the brilliant mind of <a href=#>Gary Lineker got stuck in this piece of stupidity.</a></p><p>He was joined over the weekend by another airhead, radio shock-jock <a href=#>James O’Brien.</a></p><p>I don’t listen to O’Brien’s show and cannot access his tweets.</p><p>He blocked me after I exposed his campaign to promote the lies of <a href=#>paedophile Carl Beech.</a></p><p>Fortunately I know one person who is not blocked by snowflake O’Brien.</p><p>So I was able to see his weekend “campaigning” in its full glory.</p><p>There he posted a photo of Home Secretary <a href=#>Suella Braverman </a>laughing while visiting a deportation facility and claiming she “hopes to deport trafficked <a href=#>victims of modern slavery”</a> to this place.</p><p>It portrayed an evil woman.</p><p>It is worth pausing to wonder why Braverman gets up the noses of people like O’Brien so badly.</p><p>It is because she is not behaving as people like him think she should.</p><p>Dare to be an independent or conservative-minded ethnic minority woman and unhappy men like O’Brien will come at you while shouting “feminism”.</p><p>As it happens, the photograph in question was doctored.</p><p>Specifically, the lefties cropped out the two Rwandan counterparts Braverman was sharing a joke with.</p><p>But it doesn’t matter, because truth has never detained people like O’Brien.</p><p>And won’t do now.</p><p>Happily this doesn’t matter, because the public is on the side of the <a href=#>Home Secretary.</a></p><p>A poll out last week from the Independent (hardly a bastion of the right wing) showed that 42 per cent of the public support this specific plan.</p><p>Only 25 per cent oppose it.</p><p>That is already a striking difference of opinion.</p><p>But what matters most is what happens next.</p><p>Because much of the public will be watching and waiting.</p><h2>Angry activists</h2><p>If the Rwanda plan (among other measures) works, then the public will reward the Government in the opinion polls and at the next election.</p><p>If the Government can stop <a href=#>the mass law-breaking on the south coast</a> then the figures will improve even more for.</p><p>And that would be a great thing, not just for the Government, but for this country as a whole.</p><p>It would also bring a second benefit — which is that it would show up the <a href=#>Labour Party</a> and others on the left.</p><p>As was shown this weekend, these <a href=#>angry activists</a> are not very good critics.</p><p>Not even very good insulters.</p><p>But what they are even worse at is coming up with answers.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The Government, by contrast, has come up with an answer.</p><p>For the sake of the country, we must hope that it works.</p><p class=postsid
